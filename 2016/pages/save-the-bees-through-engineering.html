    <h2><a href="https://polleneaters.wordpress.com/">Dept. Entomology, University of California, Davis</a>, Davis, CA, USA</h2>
    <p><strong>ID:</strong> MDA2</p>
    <p><strong>Relevant Skills:</strong> mechanical design, instrumentation</p>
    
    <div class="section" id="background">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Pollinator declines are a concern worldwide. It is estimated that about one
third of the human food supply is reliant on pollination by animals (Klein et
al. 2007). In the U.S. alone, crop pollination services provided by unmanaged
or “wild” insects exceed $3 billion per year (Losey &amp; Vaughn 2006).</p>
<p>The viability of wild bee populations is strongly tied to the availability of
floral resources in the landscape surrounding their nests and recent efforts
have sought approaches to predict responses of bee populations to resource
levels in the landscape around their nests.  Bumble bees are a particularly
important group of social insect pollinators and also a group of conservation
concern.  Our group is working on detailed demographic models and empirical
assessment of bumble bee population dynamics to better understand how changes
in forage (flowering plants) affect colony growth and reproduction.
Specifically, we are assessing the relationship between flowering resources and
(1) bumble bee foraging behavior and colony growth;  and (2) quantifying
feedbacks in colony response that may occur through sized-based foraging (i.e.,
differences in resource collection by worker bees of different body size. We
are seeking a highly motivated engineering student(s) to collaborate on
technical aspects of the design that involve monitoring individual bees within
colonies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-goal">
<h2>Project Goal</h2>
<p>We will assess the size of worker bees and weight of forage (i.e. nectar and
pollen) that individual worker bees bring back to the colony. We would like to
accomplish this by integrating a microbalance or strain gauge into our
monitoring system, such that individuals exiting and returning to the colony
are weighed upon exit and entry. All workers are individually tagged for
identification. Exit weights provide an assessment of worker size. Differences
between exit and entry weights for a given trip provides an estimate of
resources that individuals are bringing back to the colony. The major benefit
that such a device would provide is reducing the amount of human intervention
involved in monitoring foragers. Ideally, the scale will be connected to a
data-logger, such that weights, and their associated timestamps, are recorded
automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design-challenges">
<h2>Design Challenges</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>This project involves tiny masses (&lt;0.25 g with resolution of 0.001 grams)</li>
<li>The microbalance or strain gauge must operate in association with a living
bee colony. The engineering student will need to work closely with other
members of the team to understand how bee behavior may influence aspects of
the design.</li>
<li>Scale must be robust to outdoor application (i.e. must operate in outdoor
temperatures)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="current-assets">
<h2>Current Assets</h2>
<p>Currently, we have some elements of a preliminary design. If it would be
helpful to the engineer, we have a prototype strain gauge and CAD drawings that
can be referenced.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="broader-interest-impacts">
<h2>Broader Interest/Impacts</h2>
<p>This technology and experimental set-up are of broad interest to researchers
working with honeybees and other bees across North America, Europe, and
Australia. As such, it could be an opening to broader collaboration and
interactions.</p>
