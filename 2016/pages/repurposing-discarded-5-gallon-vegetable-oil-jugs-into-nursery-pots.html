<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>A widely publicized plastic vortex concentration reportedly the size of the
state of Texas floats north of Hawaii and the disclosure by scientist that this
plastic is found in the stomachs of seabirds, fish, and sea mammals with proven
harm will remain problematic for many years.  One proposal is to take a serious
look at reducing plastic in the environment especially the prevailing one-time-
use commercial containers that are so prevalent.   A current  non-recyclable
container is the 5 gallon vegetable oil containers (milk jug #2  plastic)
found in large quantities behind local bakeries, deli's, pizza parlor, bars,
and restaurants. The majority of these users will not take the employee time to
drain them thoroughly which is a requirement from plastics recyclers in order
for them to be recycled.</p>
<p>Even if a commercial enterprise was willing to drain them and attempt to
recycle them there are three problems to having this occur.  One problem is
that employees often do not completely remove the foiled seal tab completely
after removing the lid and merely punch out most but not all of the seal. This
blocks the lower portion of the pour spout and can result in 1/2 to 1 cup of
residual oil left in the jug. Since these jugs come in cardboard carrying boxes
there is no visual sightings of the oil left in these translucent containers.
The Second problem is that the jugs don't drain completely even if the
businesses invert them on a drain trough because they are designed incorrectly
to accomplish complete drainage of oil residues.  When inverted on a drain
board the two rounded corners aligned with the spout lie below the neck of that
spout and form miniature sumps that detain the oil. If viewed by factory
assembly line &quot;efficiency experts&quot; paid to correct obstacles and streamline
production, these containers would never  pass muster. They should be slightly
redesigned to insure complete drainage.</p>
<p>Due to the massive numbers of these containers used  nationwide little
imagination is needed to realize the amount of unmitigated oil waste.  When
these oil residues,  deemed a contaminant and render the containers
disqualified for plastics recycling, again, we can easily calculate that the
majority of them end up in landfills and detract greatly from the goal of Zero
Waste.</p>
<p>The Third Problem is that Plastics recyclers, now overly  cautious to not
contaminate their stock,  categorically eliminate  even drained containers as
a  standard practice.</p>
<p>Research to convert these jugs to diesel fuel: There has been on and off
funding for the conversion of this plastic  by pyrolysis to diesel oil. This
heating process is supposed to use the  residual oil as a fuel source in the
process of this conversion. Early reports are that the tight strands of the # 2
plastic take a substantial heat input to accomplish this process perhaps
precluding economic viability.</p>
<p>One Possible Solution:  The nursery and plant sales industry imports round,  3
and 4  gallon black plastic growing pots. If oil jugs could be mechanically
and thermally altered to replace these  pots, the U.S. could end the
importation of these current industry standards and repurpose the glut of 5
gallon jugs now relegated to landfills.</p>
<p>The challenge to the Mechanical Engineer: A device  is needed to enter the fill
spout and to expand to support the top rigidly. Next a mechanically activated
heated knife cuts an hour glass section out of the top removing the fill spout
and the carrying handle in  one action. What remains is two half circles raised
above the sides that can convert to handles when reinforced by doubling over
and heat bonding these remaining flaps. Next comes the mechanical heat induced
cutting of  oval hand holds into these opposing flaps.  This last action
provides reinforced carrying handles. Drain holes are easily provide by sharp
heated probes into the container bottoms.</p>
<p>Won't UV light break down #2 plastic over time? Yes, and this is a
consideration that has UV protection factors in the imported black pots.
However the plant can't stay in either pot too long without becoming root
bound. It is most likely to be transplanted to its permanent location before UV
breakdown becomes a limiting factor to converting to oil jug plant pots.</p>
<p>Aren't oil jugs square  and existing black containers round? Yes, the oil  jugs
would pack into tighter rows without the in-between  gaps of round pots. The
soil may be maintained warmer for earlier plant propagation and faster growth
during cooler conditions  by elimination air flow between containers.</p>
