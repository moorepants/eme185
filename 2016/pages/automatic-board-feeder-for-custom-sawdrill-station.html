<h2>Project statement</h2>
<p>This project will be to design and fabricate a automated feed system which can
present 2x4 and 4x4 lumber in 14 foot lengths to a custom automated Saw/Drill
station. This automated station was designed and fabricated in the summer of
2015 by an intern from Davis. This portion of the project will complete the
station and make it fully autonomous and automated for as many boards as will
fit in the feeder.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This machine was designed to eliminate manual handling and lumber for our
pallet fabrication. We ship measuring machines all around the world and the
crates are fabricated with 2x4 and plywood sides and top and a 4x4 and plywood
base or pallet. The most labor intensive part of the process is drilling and
cutting the lumber which this machine eliminates. It will allow us to run our
entire crating operation with 1 full time employee. The other employees will be
free to work in other areas of the company.</p>
<p>Ideally, we will maximize the automated run time of the station as well as be
able to have the software choose which size board is required for the program
being run. (2x4 or 4x4) I can give details on how the material will be brought
in and it would be acceptable to handle the material into a loader if required.
The design of the system is wide open, but cost will be a consideration. We
have an extensive machine shop and will be available to do fabrication on a
reasonable basis. The last consideration will be the floor space required.
There is no requirement, but we would like it to be as compact as possible.
Designs which utilize vertical space will aid this request.</p>
<p>We will allow students to work on site, as well as off site. Micro-Vu is a
company focused on automation and we appreciate your support helping us achieve
our goals.</p>
