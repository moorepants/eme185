    <p>We are living in the era of Internet of Things. Every house has a lawn mower,
but people are lazy to use them. I have heard a boy told his father when he
asked him to mow the lawn: &quot;this is your house, you do it.&quot; Therefore, I want
to make an automatic solar power lawn mower.</p>
<p>The mower can detect if grass exists, move to that position with a weak motor
(save energy), and then turn on a separately strong motor to cut grass. The
solar power automatic lawn mower is extremely useful for 5+ acres land because
it doesn't have to come back &quot;home&quot; for charging.  Additionally, the solar
panel can act as the weather protection for the machine.</p>
<p>TI CC3200 is my candidate for the microcontroler. According to TI's website, it
is &quot;industryâ€™s first Wi-Fi CERTIFIED single-chip microcontroller unit (MCU)
with built-in Wi-Fi connectivity.&quot; The whole system on a single chip lowers the
cost for production, and leaves the further extension of products.  It is a
very low power consumption chip, which is critical in self-power devices.</p>
<p>This idea opens the bright future for agriculture industry with Wi-Fi
capability. When I first came to the United States, I was impressed because I
saw only 1 or 2 persons worked on a farm field, compared to that of my country.
In the future, there is no human, only machines work on a farm field; while &quot;we
the people,&quot; just drinking and watching them!</p>
