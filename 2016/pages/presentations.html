<h2>Winter Quarter Studio Meetings</h2>
<p>Each team will be assigned a teaching assistant. During the studio sections,
each team will meet with the teaching assistant for 15 minutes to discuss the
weekly progress and/or the current studio activity. Every other week, you will
additionally meet with the primary instructor for an additional 15 minutes.
You must prepare an agenda for these meetings and have it available during the
meeting. <strong>Your in-class grade will be affected if you don't have an agenda or
if you don't show up to these meetings, i.e. don't waste the instructors'
time.</strong></p>

<div class="section" id="preliminary-critical-design-review">
<h2>Preliminary Critical Design Review</h2>
<p>Critical Design Reviews will be held on Thursday and Friday February 25th and
26th, 2016.</p>
<p>Your team will be scheduled for a 30 minute critical design review during the
eighth week of the winter quarter. The first 15 minutes will be for your
presentation. This will be followed by 10 minutes for the review questions and
discussion. The primary purpose of this review is for your team to justify your
concept selection and design decisions through technical details and analysis.
We are not concerned with the path to the final design (i.e., initial concepts,
etc.) but what the final concept is and why you feel confident it will work.
The intent of critical design reviews is to insure that the proper methods are
being used in analyses and that the design is valid and valuable, i.e. it meets
specifications, it can be manufactured, etc. Both your teaching assistant and
the primary instructor will be present along with other potential reviewers.
The presentation should be geared toward and &quot;engineering management&quot; audience.</p>
<p>Suggestions of what to include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A technical description of the need you are trying to solve.</li>
<li>The primary specs and metrics your solution must meet.</li>
<li>A detailed technical description of your selected concept and solution.</li>
<li>Justification for your concept solution in terms of meeting the engineering
specifications.</li>
<li>Theoretical or experimental proof that your selected concept and preliminary
design is very likely to succeed.</li>
<li>Any relevant technical preliminary design details.</li>
<li>A schedule and financial plan to execute your design.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You will need to submit your presentation materials as a PDF to Smartsite by
midnight Saturday, February 27th.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preliminary-design-presentation">
<h2>Preliminary Design Presentation</h2>
<p>During the last studio section your team will present their work and
preliminary design to the entire class, the instructors, and any project
sponsors that can attend. Groups will present their design concepts and will
justify their final selected concept.</p>
<p>The presentations will be 5 minutes comprised of an overview of the project and
selected design concept. There will 3 minutes for questions and changing
groups. This presentation will be good practice for a high level presentation
in industry (for example, to high level executives). All students are required
to attend this session.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="spring-quarter-studio-meetings">
<h2>Spring Quarter Studio Meetings</h2>
<p>Each team will meet with the instructor and their teaching assistant for 20
minutes to discuss the weekly progress. You must prepare an agenda for these
meetings and have it available during the meeting. <strong>Your in-class grade will
be affected if you don't have an agenda or if you don't show up to these
meetings, i.e. don't waste the instructors' time.</strong></p>

<div class="section" id="engineering-design-showcase-poster-presentation">
<h2>Engineering Design Showcase Poster Presentation</h2>
<p>Your team will be required to present your work at the Engineering Design
Showcase at the ARC Pavilion on Thursday June 2nd from 2-4 pm. You need to
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1TNeQLa5H-L7bvlZe-pwQ7gfwpL7Q62r3i_2lawmZb6g/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1">register for the showcase</a> by <strong>midnight April 29th</strong>. Each team will develop
a poster that showcases and explains your project which must be submitted to
both Smartsite and to Alin Wakefield for printing by <strong>12 PM Wednesday May
18th</strong>. You are also welcome and encouraged to bring any prototype that you
have constructed or videos and other media that will explain your project. Any
special accommodations for your prototype (size, power, etc) or presentation
must be coordinated with Alin Wakefield with the initial contact happening by
<strong>May 13th</strong>. At least one member of the team must be present at the poster at
all times from 2-4 pm and all team members must attend the event. Your team's
poster will be visited by one or more industry judges who will score your
poster. These scores will be taken into account for your poster presentation
grade.</p>
<div class="section" id="content-suggestions">
<h3>Content Suggestions</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that the posters should be designed for a more general audience.
Most of the visitors to the showcase will either be students, faculty, staff,
or representatives from industry. So the poster should be understandable by
people that aren't necessarily mechanical engineers. Your poster should
address:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A description of your project.</li>
<li>The main need or needs and how you've addressed them.</li>
<li>Why your project is a great solution.</li>
<li>Any innovative things you've come up with.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get ideas for posters by checking out the previous posters in the
resources section of Smartsite or those that are hanging in Bainer Hall.</p>
<p>There are many websites offering tips on making posters. Here is a good one for
scientific posters, but most of the advice is also applicable to your poster
design:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://hsp.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/ScientificPosters.pdf">http://hsp.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/ScientificPosters.pdf</a></p>
<p>Your poster should sell your ideas and yourselves. This is a great opportunity
to show your engineering prowess to the world!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software">
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>Posters can be created with a variety of software packages, for example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Slide decks software (MS
Powerpoint, LibreOffice Impress, Google Presentations, etc.)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing">Publishing software</a> (MS
Publisher, Scribus, Adobe InDesign)</li>
<li>Word processors (MS Word, LaTeX, etc.)</li>
<li>Graphics (Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, Photoshop, Gimp, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ucd-logos">
<h3>UCD Logos</h3>
<p>If you'd like to use UCD logos in your poster you can find information about
them at <a class="reference external" href="http://marketingtoolbox.ucdavis.edu/identity/logos/index.html">http://marketingtoolbox.ucdavis.edu/identity/logos/index.html</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="printing-instructions">
<h3>Printing Instructions</h3>
<p>This describes details about formatting and submitting a poster. All team
members should read this message carefully and completely to ensure a timely
and quality product.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The Engineering Dean's Office will cover the cost of printing one landscape
48&quot; W x 36&quot; H full-color poster per team. No other dimensions or sizes will
be allowed. Only 1 poster per team will be printed (no reprints).</li>

<h2>Final Critical Design Review</h2>
<p>Critical Design Reviews will be held on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday June
6th, 7th, and 8th. Your team will be scheduled for a 30 minute critical design
review during finals week of spring quarter. The first 5 minutes will be to
setup for the presentation while the reviewers grade. Then the next 15 minutes
will be for your presentation. This will be followed by 10 minutes for the
review questions and discussion.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this review is for your team to justify that your design
solves your sponsors needs through technical details, analysis, and testing. We
are not necessarily concerned with the path to the final design (i.e., initial
concepts, etc.) but what the final design is and why you feel confident it
solves the sponsor's needs. Additionally, the intent of critical design review
is to insure that the proper methods are being used in analyses and that the
design is valid and valuable, i.e. it meets specifications, it can be
manufactured, etc. The content should mirror the main content of the final
design report.</p>
<p>Your teaching assistant, the primary instructor, your sponsor, and other
potential guests will be present. The presentation should be geared toward and
&quot;engineering management&quot; audience.</p>
<p><strong>You will need to submit your presentation materials as a PDF to Smartsite by
midnight Wednesday, June 8th.</strong></p>
