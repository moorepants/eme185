    <h2><a href="http://ucanr.edu/">UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources</a>, Davis, CA, USA</h2>
    <p><strong>ID:</strong> LUR1</p>
    <p><strong>Relevant Skills:</strong> mechanical design, robotics, software</p>
    
    <p>Imagine a field of strawberries with bright red fruit hanging from the plants.
This is an alluring image to many- humans, insects and birds.  Several
effective tools are widely available for both humans and insects.  In fact,
well-developed research programs are in place for insects.  Birds on the other
hand, remain significant challenges with rather simple, not-so-effective
deterrents. For example, shiny tape attached to stakes ‘surprises’ birds with
metallic reflections (often seen in vineyards).  Another example is bird
netting placed over crops as a physical barrier, which is not realistic for
crops, like strawberry, that are harvested almost daily. Another method is
sound ‘alarms’ imitating the call of birds of prey in order to scare others
away.  Lastly, the age-old bird deterrent is the scarecrow, perhaps the least
effective of all, but entertaining nonetheless.</p>
<p>Birds are difficult to control because they learn quickly and have the ability
to fly, overcoming most physical barriers.  However, they are easy to scare and
surprise.  Capitalizing on this idea, I’d like to design a ‘scarecrow’ that is
robotic and can patrol a field.  This could be a single or troop of robots that
can move around the field and scare birds, perhaps using multiple tactics, such
as changing directions suddenly, making sounds (birds of prey calls), speeding
up quickly, and shooting water.  They would need to be able to navigate rows of
beds, uneven terrain and occasionally mud.  Bird damage is highest in rows
along the farm edge.</p>
<div class="section" id="desired-outcome">
<h2>Desired outcome</h2>
<p>We would like to have discussions with the designers to see if we can come up
with a realistic model.  We could discuss a couple of designs, for examples a
cheaper and more expensive version. We would definitely be interested in having
some design outcomes in the end and if we came up with a design we liked, we
would love to have the students build a prototype.  Local growers can be
identified where we can trial it.</p>
<p>Mentors:  Bird biologist and Farm advisor Team</p>
<p>Corey Shake is a bird biologist working in the NRCS office in Woodland who will
be able to provide expertise on bird behavior and how we can best design the
robot for the specific birds we are trying to control.</p>
<p>Corey Shake, Point Blue Conservation Science Partner Biologist,</p>
<p>Margaret Lloyd is a UCCE farm advisor in Yolo, Solano and Sacramento counties
who can provide expertise about farm practices and crop production relevant to
the design.  She can also connect design students with growers to collectively
brainstorm ideas and trial concepts.</p>
