<h2>Preliminary Design Review [Mar 4, 2019]<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id1">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your team will be scheduled for a 50 minute preliminary design review during
the ninth week of the winter quarter. The first 5 minutes will be for setup
followed by your 25 minute presentation. This will be followed by 20 minutes
for the review questions and discussion.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this review is for your team to justify your concept
selection and design decisions through technical details and analysis. We are
not as concerned with the path to the final design (i.e., initial concepts,
etc.) but what the final concept is and why you feel confident it will work.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In this presentation you are proposing a final design that you will build and
test in Spring quarter.</li>
<li>We do not need to see your eliminated designs.</li>
<li>Include engineering calculations that show your design will function as
planned. For example: Factor of safety, strength, vibrations, heat transfer,
fatigue, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The intent of design reviews is to insure that the proper methods are being
used in analyses and that the design is valid and valuable, i.e. it meets
specifications, it can be manufactured, etc. Both your teaching assistant and
the primary instructor will be present along with other potential reviewers.
The presentation should be geared toward and &quot;engineering management&quot; audience.</p>
<p><strong>Every team member should have a significant speaking role.</strong></p>
<p>Suggestions of what to include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Context and background of your project.</li>
<li>A technical description of the need you are trying to solve.</li>
<li>The primary specs and metrics your solution must meet.</li>
<li>A detailed technical description of your selected concept and solution.</li>
<li>Justification for your concept solution in terms of meeting the engineering
specifications.</li>
<li>Theoretical or experimental proof that your selected concept and preliminary
design is very likely to succeed.</li>
<li>Any relevant technical preliminary design details.</li>
<li>A schedule and financial plan to execute your design.</li>
<li>Hazard analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is essentially the presentation form of the second report, which is due
the last week of class.</p>
<p><strong>You will need to submit your presentation materials as a PDF to Canvas by
Friday of the week of the presentationn.</strong></p>

<h2>Preliminary Design Lightning Talk [Mar 14, 2019]<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id2">¶</a></h2>
<p>During the last studio section your team will present their work and
preliminary design to the entire class, the instructors, and any project
sponsors that can attend. Groups will present their design concepts and will
justify their final selected concept.</p>
<p>The presentations will be 5 minutes comprised of an overview of the project and
selected design concept. This will be followed by 3 minutes for questions and
changing groups. Only one team member will deliver the presentation, but all
team members must prepare to speak. The team member will be selected randomly
from the group at the time of presentation. This presentation will be good
practice for a high level presentation in industry (for example, to high level
executives). All students are required to attend this session.</p>
<p><strong>You will need to submit your presentation materials as a PDF to Canvas by
Friday of that week.</strong></p>

<h2>Engineering Design Showcase Poster Presentation [May 17, 2019]<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id3">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your team will be required to present your work at the <a class="reference external" href="http://engineering.ucdavis.edu/undergraduate/senior-engineering-design-showcase/">Engineering Design
Showcase</a> at the ARC Pavilion on Thursday Jun 6,
2019 from 1:00-4:00 pm. You need to <a class="reference external" href="https://">register for the showcase</a> by Friday Apr 19, 2019. Each team will develop a
poster that showcases and explains your project which must be submitted to both
Canvas and to the Dean's office for printing by Friday May 17, 2019. If you don't turn it in on
time you will jeopardize having the $75+ cost of printing covered for you. You
are also welcome and encouraged to bring any prototype that you have
constructed or videos and other media that will explain your project. Any
special accommodations for your prototype (size, power, etc) or presentation
must be coordinated with the Dean's office at registration. At least one member
of the team must be present at the poster at all times from 1:00-4:00 pm and
all team members must attend the event. Your team's poster will be visited by
one or more industry judges who will score your poster. You should wear
business attire. Your TA will visit your poster for approximately 10 minutes,
interact with you, and will grade your poster presentation for the class.</p>
<div class="section" id="content-suggestions">
<h3>Content Suggestions<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id4">¶</a></h3>
<p>Keep in mind that the posters should be designed for a more general audience.
Most of the visitors to the showcase will either be students, faculty, staff,
or representatives from industry. So the poster should be understandable by
people that aren't necessarily mechanical engineers. Your poster should
address:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A description of your project.</li>
<li>The main needs and how you've addressed them.</li>
<li>Why your project is a great solution.</li>
<li>Any innovative things you've come up with.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get ideas for posters by checking out the previous posters in the files
section of Canvas or those that are hanging in Bainer Hall.</p>
<p>There are many websites offering tips on making posters. Here is a good one for
scientific posters, but most of the advice is also applicable to your poster
design:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://hsp.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/ScientificPosters.pdf">http://hsp.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/ScientificPosters.pdf</a></p>
<p>Your poster should sell your ideas and yourselves. This is a great opportunity
to show your engineering prowess to the world!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="software">
<h3>Software<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id5">¶</a></h3>
<p>Posters can be created with a variety of software packages, for example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Slide decks software (MS Powerpoint, LibreOffice Impress, Google
Presentations, etc.)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing">Publishing software</a> (MS
Publisher, Scribus, Adobe InDesign)</li>
<li>Word processors (MS Word, LaTeX, etc.)</li>
<li>Graphics (Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, Photoshop, Gimp, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ucd-logos">
<h3>UCD Logos<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id6">¶</a></h3>

<div class="section" id="printing-instructions">
<h3>Printing Instructions<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id9">¶</a></h3>
<p>This describes details about formatting and submitting a poster. All team
members should read this message carefully and completely to ensure a timely
and quality product.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The Engineering Dean's Office will cover the cost of printing one landscape
48&quot; W x 36&quot; H full-color poster per team. No other dimensions or sizes will
be allowed. Only 1 poster per team will be printed (no reprints).</li>
<li>The poster PDF file must be submitted via the official Google form no later
than  <em>and</em> submitted to Canvas assignments at the same
time. The College will not accept nor print any file received after this
deadline.</li>
<li>Files must be submitted as a PDF (highest quality preferred).</li>
<li>When designing your poster, please carefully check the page setup settings.
You must ensure your poster is correctly sized at 48&quot; W x 36&quot; H.</li>
<li>The CoE cannot be responsible for verifying the accuracy of technical
content, so you are strongly advised to have your instructor review your
poster prior to submission.</li>
<li>Once printed, the posters will be stored in Kemper Hall. The College will
arrange for setup and display of all posters in the Pavilion on the day of
the showcase. Posters will be mounted to foam/poster board for stability and
easier viewing.</li>
<li>If you do not want to keep your poster you should return it to the EME 185
instructors after the showcase and it will possibly be displayed in Bainer
Hall the following year.</li>

<h2>Critical Design Review [Jun 10, 2019]<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id10">¶</a></h2>
<p>Critical Design Reviews will be held during the first three days of exam week.
Your team will be scheduled for a 50 minute critical design review during
finals week of spring quarter. The first 5 minutes will be for setup followed
by your 25 minute presentation. This will be followed by 20 minutes for the
review questions and discussion.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this review is for your team to justify that your design
solves your sponsors needs through technical details, analysis, and testing. We
are not necessarily concerned with the path to the final design (i.e., initial
concepts, etc.) but what the final design is and why you feel confident it
solves the sponsor's needs. Additionally, the intent of critical design review
is to insure that the proper methods are being used in analyses and that the
design is valid and valuable, i.e. it meets specifications, it can be
manufactured, etc. The content should mirror the main content of the final
design report.</p>
<p>Your teaching assistant, the primary instructor and potentially your sponsor
and other potential guests will be present. The presentation should be geared
toward and &quot;engineering management&quot; audience.</p>
<p><strong>You will need to submit your presentation materials as a PDF to Canvas by
11:59PM Wednesday of exam week.</strong></p>
