    <p>These are some recommendations for finding items you might need for your
project. For instructions on how to make purchases, see the <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/mae-purchasing-guidelines.html">MAE Purchasing
Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>For additional resources, go to the Engineering Fabrication Laboratory (Bainer
1220) and get a copy of their industrial contact list. It contains many
suppliers and services not listed here.</p>

<h2>General Advice<a class="headerlink" href="#general-advice" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>While purchasing parts online is convenient, it may be cost and time
effective to browse locally first. Suppliers like McMaster-Carr, Grainger,
etc. can deliver rapidly, but you are paying a premium for that service.</li>
<li>80/20 is not the only way to make a sturdy frame.</li>
<li>Perform a realistic evaluation of the quality of materials required. You may
or may not require high-speed tool steel, but you should know for sure before
buying any.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="http://bae.engineering.ucdavis.edu/bae-shop/">Biological and Agricultural Engineering shop</a> can be hired for
machining, welding, and other fabrication services.</li>
<li>There are some online services like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.makexyz.com">makexyz</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.shapeways.com">shapeways</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sculpteo.com">sculpteo</a>, etc.
which let you upload CAD models and get back a 3D-printed part.</li>

<h2>Electrical<a class="headerlink" href="#electrical" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In general, simple electronic parts like passives (resistors, capacitors),
discrete components (transistors), and even bare microcontrollers are
inexpensive compared to mechanical parts. Always consider ordering several
extras in case a part is compromised in some way. Components can be quickly
destroyed by accidentally reversing polarity while prototyping, applying heat
for too long during soldering, or through electrostatic discharge.</p>
<p>If purchasing online, pay attention to the minimum quantity offered for a part.
Cheap components like resistors are often packaged in bulk.</p>
<p>While not very common in ME senior design, you may want to produce a printed
circuit board for your project. There are two basic options for getting a board
printed:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Your board is one among several others being fabricated on a single panel.
This option is slow (~2 weeks) but very inexpensive. One good option based in
the US is <a class="reference external" href="https://oshpark.com/">OSH Park</a>.</li>
<li>The more typical fabrication house treats your project on its own. Since they
don't have to wait for other orders to come in to fill a panel, this method
is faster (days) but more expensive than the communal option. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.4pcb.com/">Advanced
Circuits</a> is one example. Check for student discounts.</li>
