    <h1 class="entry-title">Optimal Mountain Bike Rim Design</h1>
    <h2><a href="http://www.feltbicycles.com">Felt Bicycles</a>, Irvine, CA</h2>
    <p><strong>Relavant Skills:</strong> mechanical design, strength of materials, finite element analysis,
composites</p>
    
    <p>More and more manufacturers are making mountain bike rims out of carbon fiber
to decrease weight and increase stiffness and strength. Lots of designs are
coming out, and we've been observing the trends and trying to figure out what
rim shapes will perform best. We'd like to get help from a design team to
optimize the shape of a rim for mountain bikes. What I would propose is that we
will supply the basic dimensions and shape for the tire bed, and the team will
design the shape for the sidewalls and outer wall (part that interfaces with
the spokes).</p>
<p>Lateral stiffness-to-weight will be the primary metric, but we're interested in
the lateral stiffness of the wheel as a whole. Therefore the analysis could
include FEA of the rim shape, plus simpler calculations to involve the hub and
spokes.</p>
<p>The shape does not need to be symmetric, and because it will be molded in
composites (rather than extruded like metal rims), it does not need to be a
constant cross section. There is also the possiblity of getting the design into
the layup schedule for prototype construction to add another dimension to the
project.</p>
<p>Felt doesn't have any immediate plans to produce a MTB rim, but we work with a
factory that is starting to work on their own designs. If we feel that the team
has come up with a viable design, we may give the design to this factory to
produce as their &quot;open mold&quot; (meaning that any company could buy it from the
factory and brand it as their own, including Felt).</p>
