    <div class="section" id="the-problem">
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Most shovel manufacturing formerly done in the U.S. has been sent overseas
mainly to China. The majority of the imports have wooden handles but a smaller
portion are imported with fiberglass handles. Thailand, the Philippines, and
other Asia countries are stripping out hard wood forest for the American
markets and shovel handles are included in the mix of products. The trend now
is the use of poor quality wood to provide competitive pricing. This results
is broken, short-lived shovels that end up in the landfill.</p>
<p>Wood handled shovels have another innate defect. The tapered handles fit into
the socket and are secured by a drilled hole traversing the handle where
moisture is trapped in both the larger socket and the rivet hole leading to
wood rot and premature breakage. The postmortems show that with the leveraging
action of the shovel the breaks occur at the rivet hole as its weakest
structural point. The question becomes what inexpensive, locally-available
product will allow the refitting of a more durable handle adding to years of
service, avoiding the cost of foreign imports, eliminating the use hard woods
and the foundry pollution of steel smelting more shovel heads?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-local-solution">
<h2>The Local Solution</h2>
<p>There are four little known sources of shovel handles.</p>
<p>Source #1) As cable and dish T.V. has come to dominate the market , high
quality galvanized pipe T.V. antennas are being removed and sent to the Asian
scrap metal market. Basically the U.S. enters the inferior position in a
colonial relationship with primarily China. We send them scrap metal in the
form of T.V. antennas. They melt them down in polluting smelters (along with
broken shovel heads from the same origin) and then they extrude pipe the same
diameter of shovel handles and stamp out steel plate sheets to make shovel
heads. Both these products end up exported to the U.S. To circumvent this
wasteful paradigm we use the discarded items locally with only slight
modifications before assembling into usable products.</p>
<p>Source #2) We import nearly all our electrical conduit used in wiring for
commercial and residential applications. When buildings are demolished we strip
out the electrical (EMT) conduit and add it to the Asian scrap metals markets.
The one inch diameter EMT stock can be fitted to shovel heads. The smaller
diameter EMT fits up to rake and hoe heads of which there is a large stock.</p>
<p>Source #3) China sends us many metal shade structures for camping, car ports,
and green houses, etc. When the shade covers deteriorate owners ofter find
there are no after-market replacement covers and the steel structures still in
excellent condition are ending up in landfills. Most of the steel piping is
the correct size for shovel handles and the smaller stock is the appropriate
size for refitting to garden rakes and hoes.</p>
<p>Source #4) Many steel store display racks are discarded when the items they are
displaying are discontinued or the racks show signs of wear or aging. The round
stock of display racks (often unused and still in their original shipping
boxes) are often the correct size for refitting to garden tool heads of various
types including shovels.</p>
<p>Is there a supply of recycled tool heads?: Yes. Farms and garden projects have
an abundant and growing supply of heads that would grow even larger if people
saw that they are a valuable, recyclable item and not to be thrown in the
trash. The scrap yards could be paid the labor cost of setting them aside and
derive more profit supplying local tool makers than the low value from current
scrap markets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="back-to-the-problem-and-the-challenge-to-the-mechanical-engineers">
<h2>Back to the Problem and the challenge to the Mechanical Engineers</h2>
<p>The round stock highlighted above for shovel handle application requires that
the pipe handles be reduced in size on one end to fit into the narrowing socket
of the shovel in preparation for securing the head with a rivet. Only 6-7
inches in length at one end needs this reduction. This is the biggest
impediment in re-manufacturing broken shovels and must be overcome to
increasing competitiveness with the imported sources.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-device-needed">
<h3>The Device Needed</h3>
<p>A crimping device that will indent the last 6-7&quot; of the pipe
down the center and then roll the sides to further reduce the diameter is
needed. Two types of crimping devices would be most helpful. One hydraulic for
commercial manufacturing applications and the other a leverage tool on the
model of a construction site rebar cutter for home use and smaller scale tool
repair workshops.</p>
<p>The Torema Concept (Totally Recycled Materials) should be kept in mind in the
making of these devices. A survey of recycled materials would be an initial
step to build components with commonly discarded materials that would allow
duplication of the devices in other cities when interested parties are
provided with clear instructions and blueprints. Durability and ease of repair
are not precluded by the use of recycled materials and, often, the opposite is
true.</p>
<p>Will re-manufactured tools supply the entire U.S. market? No, because the feed
stock derives from post-consumer recycled content but this model is very
advantageous for the already stated reasons to not be consider at a time of
growing concerns of climate change. In essence, in economic terms, it is the
&quot;harvesting of the low hanging fruit.&quot; It can also stimulate questions
regarding current U.S. manufacturing models of questionable efficacy.</p>
<p>The possibility of device commercialization: If employment promotion
organizations find tool repair a possibility in their mission goals there exist
the possibility of online ordering of either of the two devices. The other
options is the sale of diagrams and instructions for the DIYers.</p>
<p>Current Market Downturn in the Recyclables Market: As China's economy has
slowed prices in more traditional recyclables have plummeted. Cardboard, paper,
plastic, tin cans have lower demand. The metals market with scrap steel,
aluminum, copper, brass, etc. has followed. With a needed thorough review of
our industrial practices it would seem advantageous to be insulated from
foreign market swings and bring to the table all the advantages of taking back
segments of our manufacturing capabilities we too often declare uneconomic to
pursue.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-problem-in-the-big-concept">
<h2>The Problem in the Big Concept</h2>
<p>We are downcycling locally available feed stock we already possess, abrogating
our evolving philosophy to be less polluting, contributing to the trade
imbalance, outsourcing jobs, unnecessarily using limited funds for job
retraining programs, and contributing to local unemployment.</p>
