<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>ARMA USA currently holds the utility patent No. 7412975 for a hand held gas
propelled missile launcher. This hand held gas propelled missile launcher
deploys projectiles of varying payloads through the muzzle and a ballistic
module for changing payloads expeditiously.</p>
<p>One of those payloads patented is a line launching payload for multiple uses
where a line of 100 feet, approximately needs to be launched.</p>
<p>The line launching payload would be used to support rescue operations on land
and water as well as other operations requiring a line connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-objectives">
<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
<p>The project presented is to take this patented payload element and design it to
work efficiently and reliably using a base cartridge system that is used in the
hand held missile launcher. Prototype components have been designed and made,
however they need to be evaluated and have design changes made for them to work
successfully.</p>
<p>Part of the project is to design and build parts required to make the system
perform at its optimum. In addition, this project includes designing and
building the equipment needed to manufacture the cartridge and function
correctly; such as properly and repeatedly winding the line used in the device
to be deployed successfully.</p>
<p>In addition, the project requires sourcing of the lightest, smallest  and
strongest material that can be found for the line to be deployed a minimum of
100 feet.</p>
<p>Hardware to be Provided:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Basic Launcher Unit</li>
<li>Air Cylinders for testing</li>
<li>Ancillary materials as defined by project budget established</li>
</ul>
