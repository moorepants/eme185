<p>In general, you will create a number of memos that document your team's
accomplishments and progress. The memos should all be turned in to Canvas
Assignments by 10 PM on the respective due date.</p>
<p>Each memo should stand on its own and you will be able to use the content as a
base to develop the reports. In addition to turning in the assignment, you
should share these memos with your project sponsor(s) for feedback but the main
audience you should address are the course instructors.</p>
<p>The memos should have no more than three pages of main content and an optional
appendices. The &quot;main content&quot; is defined as the essential text, figures,
tables, etc. to tell your story. Additionally, feel free to link to rich media:
videos, websites, demos, etc. This main content should stand on its own without
the appendices. The appendices can include labeled and captioned figures,
tables, drawings, renderings, analyses, source code, and other relevant
material to support the story told in your main content pages if the reader
desires to understand further details. Reference the items in the appendices in
the main text. The appendices should not be required to understand the main
content.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Each memo must be submitted as a single PDF document made up of 8.5&quot; x 11&quot;
sheets to Canvas. <strong>You will be docked points if you submit a format other
than PDF.</strong></li>
<li>Your group is free to use any software you prefer to prepare the documents.
<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>.</li>
<li>The audience you should write for is a technically competent reader, e.g.
another engineering colleague or engineering management, and/or your project
sponsor.</li>
<li>They should be treated as a professional documents and formatted as such.</li>
<li>Check out this <a class="reference external" href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-003-principles-of-engineering-practice-spring-2010/labs/MIT3_003S10_memo.pdf">MIT document</a> for memo writing tips.</li>

<h2>Memo 1: Project Selection [Due: Friday, Jan 12, 2018]<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id3">¶</a></h2>
<p>This &quot;memo&quot; will be in the form of a CATME Team Maker Survey and your résumé.
You will receive a notice via email for CATME and will need to fill out the
survey on the CATME website. Your résumé should be turned in via Canvas as a
single PDF. <strong>Note that your résumé should not exceed more that two pages.</strong></p>
<p>The CATME Survey will be accessed via this link:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.catme.org/">https://www.catme.org/</a></p>
<p>Resources for developing your résumé can be found on the
<a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/resources.html">resources page</a>.</p>
<p>CATME takes into account all of the information that you provide it and
attempts to algorithmically select optimal teams to align schedules, distribute
similar and dissimilar qualities, and ensure a project of your choice. We will
read your your résumé to get to know you a bit better and to provide you
feedback for improving it for the upcoming <a class="reference external" href="https://icc.ucdavis.edu/employer/fairs.htm">Engineering Career Fair</a> (Jan 24).
You will also provide your résumé to your project client once your team is
assigned.</p>
<p>I make all of my projects available to students in both sections (A02, A03) but
each selected group will have to attend the same section. If you are willing to
switch from attending Thursday to attending Friday or vice versa, then you will
have a larger chance of getting the project you want. Please indicate in the
survey if you can switch sections only if you have no time conflicts.</p>

<h2>Memo 2: Team Charter [Due: Friday, Jan 26, 2018]<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id4">¶</a></h2>
<p>A team charter is a document that specifies your team's purpose and the
organizational principles you will use to fulfill that purpose. Generating
a team charter is an important process that will help to establish team goals,
list strategies to achieve those goals, identify strengths of individual team
members, and formalize team members' agreements and commitments to one another.</p>
<p>Throughout the next two quarters, refer back to your charter to ensure that
you're on the course you set for yourselves at the beginning. Your charter is
a living document, however, so you should also revise it if member roles and
responsibilities change throughout the project.</p>
<p>With your group members, select a company name and write a 1-page charter
following this <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/team-charter-template.html">team charter template</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="memo-3-needs-and-specs-due-due-dates-mem-03-strftime-a-b-d-y">
<h2>Memo 3: Needs and Specs [Due: Friday, Feb 2, 2018]<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id5">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this memo is to summarize what you have learned from the
stakeholders in your project, in particular your sponsors' needs and desired
outcomes. You should use the initial conversations with the sponsor to learn
much as possible. <strong>As soon as the projects are assigned you should initiate
contact with your sponsor for an interview.</strong></p>
<p>For the first part of the memo, the purpose will be to communicate the
sponsor's needs in your own language as you understand them, including implicit
needs you identify which the sponsor may not explicitly state. We recommend
using the techniques explained in Chapter 5 and in class to generate these
needs.</p>
<p>Secondly, you should show preliminary target specifications based on the needs
that you have found. Techniques for generating the specifications from the
needs are provided in Chapter 6, where the first portion explains getting to
target specs.</p>
<p>Other items to include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Summary of the problem, i.e. the mission statement.</li>
<li>The organized identified needs (appendices).</li>
<li>The organized target specifications (appendices).</li>
<li>Reflections on the process and the results.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Memo 4: Concept Selection [Due: Friday, Mar 2, 2018]<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id6">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this memo is to show that you have narrowed down your concepts
and have a solution that you want to move forward with. Ideally, you have one
concept at this point, but if not, you should be down to a very minimal set of
choices and have a strong justification as to why you are having a hard time
deciding. Finally, you should show that your selected concept has a very high
probability of meeting your target specs and solving your problem.</p>
<p>Suggestions of what to include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A detailed description of your selected concept.</li>
<li>Proof that indicates this concept will meet all or most of your target
specifications. If it doesn't meet all of them, justification as to why is
needed.</li>
<li>Justification for your elimination of the abandoned concepts.</li>
<li>A description of your selection process to document why you ended up with the
selected choice.</li>
<li>Any screening or scoring charts/tables/graphs, etc.</li>
</ul>
