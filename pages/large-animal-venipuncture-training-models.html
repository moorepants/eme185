    <h1 class="entry-title">Large Animal Venipuncture Training Models</h1>
    <h2><a href="">Department of Medicine and Epidemiology, School of Veterinary Medicine</a>, Davis, CA, USA</h2>
    <p><strong>ID:</strong> MDL9</p>
    <p><strong>Relevant Skills:</strong> materials, fluids, anatomy</p>
    
    <p>Veterinary students need to practice skills to achieve clinical competency. One
key skill is the ability to accurately place an intravenous catheter into the
jugular veins of large animals and administer intravenous fluids. In this era
of humane science education and heightened awareness of animal welfare,
veterinary education is moving towards the use of models rather than live
animals.</p>
<p>Models provide practical experience without causing ethical concerns or patient
risk and range in sophistication from simple task completion to high-tech
computer components, which would record pressures of liquid flow. The challenge
is to have lifelike models for the students.</p>
<p>Large animal simulation products are in the market and can be found at
<a class="reference external" href="http://vetsimulators.net/">http://vetsimulators.net/</a>, but these models focus on suture practice and organ
palpation. Intravenous simulation products are available, but focus on small
animals <a class="reference external" href="http://veteffects.com/products.htm">http://veteffects.com/products.htm</a> and humans
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.anatomywarehouse.com/manikins-and-simulators/patient-care-trainers/injection-venipuncture-trainers">https://www.anatomywarehouse.com/manikins-and-simulators/patient-care-trainers/injection-venipuncture-trainers</a>.
High tech human models are used at a human healthcare training center in
England <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bmsc.co.uk/">http://www.bmsc.co.uk/</a>.</p>
<p>We are seeking head/neck equine and bovine models with a recessed jugular
furrow containing a simulated jugular vein on both sides of the neck. The
material covering the simulated vein should approximate the thickness and
resistance of normal hide. The simulated vein would be distended with a red
liquid, which would empty into a receptacle or be recycled to maintain
pressure.</p>
<p>Ideally, the student designed durable models will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>appear realistic and be anatomically correct</li>
<li>contain a tubular structure that will distend and collapse like a vein</li>
<li>have a replaceable tubular structure and simulated hide</li>
<li>contain some element of computer component technology</li>
</ul>
<p>We have access to a company in California with system of hot wire tools that
are used to cut rigid styrofoam, <a class="reference external" href="https://hotwirefoamfactory.com/">https://hotwirefoamfactory.com/</a>. The resulting
creations are coated with a stabilizing material. We could request animal
models be cut by the company and the students would modify them to insert the
simulated jugular vein. If desired, the cutting tools can be made available and
the students could design and cut the animal models themselves.</p>
<p>Mentoring is available for anatomical correctness and understanding of
venipuncture considerations. The design team will be encouraged to evaluate
their fabrications by organizing trainings for veterinary students.
Supplemental funding is available for additional materials needed for project.
If successful, these models could become vital pieces of training equipment for
veterinary students here at UC Davis and perhaps marketed to other veterinary
and veterinary technician schools.</p>
