<h2>Introduction<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id9">¶</a></h2>
<p>Two reports will be due during the winter quarter and two reports will be due
during the spring quarter:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Project Proposal</li>
<li>Preliminary Design</li>
<li>Midterm Progress Update</li>
<li>Final Design Report</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that each report should be standalone. You may refer to earlier
reports, but each report should provide adequate information to allow a reader
to fully understand what is being presented and why without reading any of the
other reports. The reports should be directed to other personnel that may not
have detailed knowledge of the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="report-format">
<h2>Report Format<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id10">¶</a></h2>
<p>The reports will be due in PDF format via Canvas by the due dates and times
posted in the <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/schedule.html">schedule</a> and on the Canvas
assignment. A single report should be submitted by one team member.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The report should be formatted to fit on 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; sheets of paper <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>.</li>
<li>All margins should be 1&quot;.</li>
<li>The font size of main text should be 11 or 12 pt.</li>
<li>The font size in captions can be as small as 10 pt.</li>
<li>Number and caption all figures and tables.</li>
<li>All graphics should be legible with adequate font sizes and clear lines.</li>
<li>Include page numbers on every sheet.</li>
<li>Equations should be numbered and rendered as proper mathematical notation.</li>
<li>Any standard citation style is permitted (e.g. IEEE, Havard, APA, MLA, etc.),
but one must be used.</li>
<li>The reports should be treated as a professional documents and formatted as
such.</li>
<li>The audience you should write for is a technically competent reader, e.g.
another engineering colleague or engineering management.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1trrXnfDmXD1O9vuXVe93zd4pJ7v1kVvikJ0BHjMBngo/edit?usp=sharing">Report Style Guide</a> for visual explanations of these formatting
rules. Feel free to use the document as a template. For report writing tips see
the slides from lecture that are available on Canvas. Past reports are
available on Canvas Files. These should only be shared among students in the
class.</p>

<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>Be sure to either scale layout drawings correctly with legible font
sizes or print them in the appendices on larger paper sizes.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="section" id="title-page">
<h3>Title Page<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id11">¶</a></h3>
<p>The title page should include the title, authors, team name, project title,
date, course section, and an abstract (&lt;150 words). The abstract should inform
the reader what they will find in the report, i.e. what it is about and what it
concludes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id3">
<h3>Table of Contents<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id12">¶</a></h3>
<p>The next page(s) of your report should include a table of contents, list of
figures, and list of tables showing a title and page number for all items.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="content-sections">
<h3>Content Sections<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id13">¶</a></h3>
<p>These sections should contain the essential text, figures, tables, etc. to tell
your story. This main content should be understandable without having to delve
into the optionally provided appendices, e.g. don't refer to figures in the
appendix if discussed in detail in the content sections, include the figure (or
simpler version of the figure) near the relevant text.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contributions">
<h3>Contributions<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id14">¶</a></h3>
<p>Provide a brief section that describes each author's contribution to the
report. This should only be one to two sentences per author. For example:
&quot;Carlos was the primary author of the buckling analysis and plan sections,
contributed to the introduction, handled organizing and formatting the
references, and edited the entire paper.&quot;</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="references">
<h3>References<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id15">¶</a></h3>
<p>All text and materials in the paper that were not created by your team must be
cited here. Be sure to up-hold copyright laws on any included material or be
sure they fall under fair-use. Use any citation style that you prefer that
fully communicates the reference, but you must make use of one. Note that URLs
do not make adequate citations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="appendices">
<h3>Appendices<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id16">¶</a></h3>
<p>The appendices can be any length and contain details that do not belong in the
content section(s). This could include large figures, sketches, layout
drawings, 3D renderings, detailed calculations, big tables, short source code
snippets, etc. Basically, anything that takes attention away from the main
points but provides the details that back up the main content should go in the
appendices. Keep in mind that the content sections should stand on their own.
Additionally, feel free to link to rich media: videos, websites, demos, etc.</p>

<div class="section" id="technical-documentation-explanation-and-examples">
<h2>Technical Documentation Explanation and Examples<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id17">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="layout-drawings">
<h3>Layout Drawings<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id18">¶</a></h3>
<p>You should refer to a good engineering graphics text for examples of layout
drawings. We expect you to create layout drawings for your mechanical,
electrical, and architectural designs. A mechanical layout drawing is drawn to
scale and must show the shape, size, and position of all parts. It should show
how the parts fit together and if they will function properly. All parts should
be fully dimensioned using standards for the drawing type. The design details
are worked out on this drawing. The designer additionally uses the layout
drawing to show and sell his design and ideas to his management; it is used by
drafts people to prepare detailed part drawings and an assembly drawing; it is
used by manufacturing engineers to determine manufacturing processes and costs
although this has been increasingly incorporated into the design process. How
detailed should it be? It must be adequately complete so that it can meet the
above uses. If it is not necessary to ask how the design works or what a
particular part looks like, etc., then the layout is adequate. The ideal
drawing package is one that can be passed to the fabricators so they can create
your product without having to ask you any questions and it comes back as
specified.</p>
<div class="section" id="tips">
<h4>Tips<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id19">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All drawings should be scaled properly for the paper size. The scale should
be noted and if the drawing is printed on the specified paper size, the
drawing should be to scale in the printed product.</li>
<li>Use standard symbols and styles appropriate for the type of drawing.</li>
<li>Have an informative title block and use the same template for all of our
drawings.</li>
<li>Always include default tolerances, surface finishes, etc.</li>
<li>Note all material types on the drawings.</li>
<li>Providing more notes is better than providing fewer notes. Always explain
anything that standard drawing symbols can't communicate.</li>
<li>Use GD&amp;T when basic tolerancing is not sufficient to describe the desired
outcome of the part.</li>
<li>Do not over define your part with too many dimensions. Use the bare minimum
needed to describe the size.</li>
<li>Choose dimensions that are most useful for the fabricator that will make your
part. You should think about how the part will be made and how the part will
be measured.</li>
<li>The is not need to make layout drawings for purchased parts. Only make
drawings for those things you need to fabricate and assemble.</li>

<div class="section" id="bill-of-materials">
<h3>Bill of Materials<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id21">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Bill of Materials or Parts List is a tabular list of all of the parts,
components, sub-assemblies, etc. that are needed to manufacture and/or test
your design. Both manufactured items and purchased items are included. The list
should include part numbers, part names, number required, material, whether
purchased or fabricated, and if purchased, the name and part number of the
supplier with associated costs. The Bill of Materials is used for such aspects
as: insuring that all parts are on hand when production begins, to ensure that
detailed drawings are prepared for all components, for planning of the
manufacturing process, etc. This document should be able to be provided to a
purchaser and they are able to order the parts without having to ask you more
details.</p>

<h2>Report #1: Project Proposal [Due: Friday, Feb 15, 2019]<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id25">¶</a></h2>
<p>The primary purpose of the project proposal is for your team to clearly
articulate your understanding of the customer's needs and to share your
preliminary research findings, concepts, first quarter timeline, preliminary
budget, and goals. This story should convince your instructors and sponsors
that you have a clear understanding of the needs, have a realistic scope, have
a broad set of solution possibilities, and are ready to move forward with
design, analysis, and final concept selection.</p>
<p>This document should be shared with your sponsor(s) by email (cc the instructor
and TA) for feedback in addition to being turned into Canvas. Be sure to adjust
the content to best fit this combined audience.</p>
<p><strong>The main content sections of the report should not exceed 6 pages.</strong></p>
<p>The project proposal should address the following things:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Context and Background</dt>
<dd>Here, you should introduce your problem in context with respect to your
sponsor's work, their broader goals, society, and contemporary issues.</dd>
<dt>Mission Statement</dt>
<dd>State and define your problem and objectives as clearly as you can. If your
proposal deals with the smaller component of a larger problem, discuss your
problems significance relative to the total system.</dd>
<dt>Identified customer needs</dt>
<dd>Use this section to show a more detailed view of the identified needs. It is
important that you sponsor see that you've understood their needs. Note that
you may also have discovered needs that your sponsor didn't explicitly
describe, so use this opportunity to share those with your sponsor. Make use
of ranked needs tables to document all of your needs. The large superset of
needs should likely go in the appendices.</dd>
<dt>Refined target specifications</dt>
<dd>List as many design specifications as you can at this time including such
aspects as capacities, speeds, size, weight, cost, etc. as well as any other
specific and/or general requirements and specifications for your design. You
should indicate which needs correspond to the specifications. Make use of
the relevant tables in Chapter 6 of the book to present this information.
You should include any relevant engineering codes and standards that will
have bearing on your specifications.</dd>
<dt>External concepts and existing solutions</dt>
<dd>It should be clear that you've &quot;done your homework&quot;, i.e. searched for
existing solutions and used them to help develop your specifications and
concepts. Compare specs from existing solutions to your desired specs.
At minimum include a competitive benchmarking table (Ex 6-7).</dd>
<dt>Initial design concepts</dt>
<dd>You should have a large number of concepts to share at this point. Be sure
to show these off so that your sponsor can see that there are a wide range
of possible solutions to their needs. Make use of functional diagrams,
concept combination trees, and concept combination tables to organize this
information. Discuss and highlight the most promising concepts based on any
concept selection you have done. Show how the concepts meet the needs using
at least concept screening. You can present a single concept selection if
your screening identified one or present your top 3 or so designs if you
haven't quite homed in on a solution.
At minimum include either a functional diagram (Ex. 7-4, Ex. 10-6), concept
classification tree (Ex. 7-7), or a concept conbination table (7-9).
At minimum include several concept examples (Ex. 8-3), these can be hand drawn
and can be smaller than exmples shown.</dd>
<dt>Preliminary planning and scheduling</dt>
<dd>The preliminary plan should give at least a coarse idea of the important
milestones you will need to meet for the remaining weeks of the course, i.e.
now until ~June 15th. You should include a <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/gantt-charts.html">Gantt chart</a> with the details. Here is an <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/docs/Shoe-Tie-Machine_GANTT.pdf">example</a> Gantt chart from a previous EME 185 project.</dd>
<dt>Preliminary budget</dt>
<dd>The purpose of the preliminary budget statement is to give a very rough idea
of what expected project costs may be for your top designs. This will vary
based on your or your sponsor's desire to construct a prototype or run
testing. The instructors and sponsors will use this number to start planning
resource allocation. A refined budget for a single design will be presented
in the final report of the winter quarter.</dd>
</dl>
<p>You may add other information that is deemed necessary to &quot;sell&quot; your proposal.
Use your memo as a building block for the proposal. The instructors and
sponsors will evaluate your report to determine the size and scope of your
project and if the objectives are both well thought out and feasible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="report-2-preliminary-design-due-due-dates-rep-02-strftime-a-b-d-y">
<h2>Report #2: Preliminary Design [Due: Monday, Mar 18, 2019]<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id26">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of the preliminary design report is to present your selected
design, show that it is highly likely to work and that your goals will
realistically be able to be completed by the end of the spring quarter. This
document should provide sufficient technical information, engineering analyses,
and/or test results to give the instructors and your sponsors confidence the
presented solution will meet the sponsors' needs and all of your target specs.
Additionally, you will need to clearly state what you plan to accomplish by the
end of the course and how you will do that.</p>
<p>Note that your design does not yet have to be complete and polished but the
main concepts should be formally described in enough technical detail to make
your case. Furthermore, it is not a requirement to have a physical realization
of your solution for this class. Your sponsors are aware of this. You can pass
the course with high marks by presenting a comprehensive design that is ready
to be built, i.e. enough information to pass onto other engineers and/or
fabricators. But we encourage you to develop simple prototypes as part of the
design process and a final prototype for your sponsor, as you are likely to
learn much more by doing so and be better prepared for the future.</p>
<p>The report should cover at least the following topics:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Introduction</dt>
<dd>You should introduce your problem in context with respect to your sponsors
work and their broader goals. The sponsor's needs should be clearly
explained along with the associated target specifications that you've
developed from the needs. Your mission statement should be clearly defined
with respect to these. The sub-problems you have to solve should be clearly
described and how they relate to the main problem. This can also include
comparisons of your solution to existing solutions and any relevant
literature that helps put your problem and solution into context.</dd>
<dt>Concept Description</dt>
<dd>Ideally, you are down to one concept or one plan of action (for
computational and physical experiments) that you are ready to move forward
with. You should fully describe your design to clearly explain how it
functions. The goal is to provide sufficient technical details to get across
the conceptual design. For example, how a mechanism will work or how all
your parts will fit together in the limited physical space. Be sure to make
heavy use of graphical means to communicate the design. The minimal
description should be based on the &quot;product architecture&quot; described in
Chapter 10 of the book and in class. The system architecture will be
presented through preliminary schematics and layout drawings of the design,
discussion of the various subsystems, and discussion of the interface
between the various subsystems. But you are welcome to present more details
of your design if you are further along.
At minimum include either an architecture diagram (Ex. 10-7).
At minimum include an annotated drawing of your concept (Ex. 8-6).</dd>
<dt>Concept Justification</dt>
<dd>Your selected design should have sufficient justification to prove that it
is very likely to work. You can prove this in a number of ways, e.g.
engineering analysis, simulation, experimental testing, or through simple
prototyping. Simple analytical models and tests are sufficient to prove
that concepts will likely work. You will be able to refine these during the
second quarter to further justify your work. You can also describe your
decisions to abandon other design concepts. This helps build your case that
your design is the right choice.</dd>
<dt>Plan</dt>
<dd>You should include a very refined project plan that breaks the remainder of
the project timeline into a set of dependent tasks and milestones. Every
task should have a duration, due date, its dependencies, and an assignee(s).
This information should be presented as a <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/gantt-charts.html">Gantt Chart</a> in addition to some text that explains
the high level view of the plan. Here is an <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/docs/Shoe-Tie-Machine_GANTT.pdf">example</a> Gantt chart from a previous EME 185 project.</dd>
<dt>Financing</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The costs should be refined as much as possible to give a very realistic
estimate of what you plan to spend. A refined budget and bill of materials
(see definition above) should be included with best estimates of all project
costs. Be sure to account for cost overruns, shipping, tax, and any other
indirect costs.  This bill of materials will be your and the instructors'
guide to purchasing.</p>
<p class="last">If your sponsor is not covering the costs (or all of the costs) of your
project you will need to include a statement that requests money from the
MAE department. You must include the amount of money from any other sources
with this request. We will evaluate the requests and try to provide you with
your requested amount from the limited available money by the start of the
spring quarter. There is no guarantee that you will get what you ask for.
This will be based off the amount requested and the quality of your work.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Hazard Analysis</dt>
<dd>You shall include a hazard analysis of your design using Failure Modes and
Effects Analysis (FMEA) (half page max). Identify the hazards, risks, and
implemented controls.  Include a concise description within this section of
each hazard that can cause an injury and a control for how your team
minimizes the hazards.  Describe only the highest risk hazards. Include only
a concise FMEA table in the report. Extensive tables of your FMEA can be
included in the appendix.</dd>
<dt>Appendices</dt>
<dd>The appendices should include any details that support the content of your
paper. <strong>Note that the report should make complete sense if the appendices
are removed.</strong> It should include sufficient details that document your work
this quarter. This should be highly organized and easy to follow. At this
point you can include details of your concept generation and selection
process, your full set of needs and specs, CAD renderings, sketches,
diagrams, abandoned designs, in-depth tasks lists and charts, extensive bill
of materials, etc.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This report should be self contained. Imagine if someone that has never seen
your work picks up your report and wants to understand it in depth without you
present. Your report should include sufficient information for them to
understand your design and justification.</p>
<p><strong>Note that the main content of the report should not exceed 10 pages.</strong></p>
<p>Be sure to utilize your memos, proposal, and critical design review as a basis
for your report. Use the feedback from them all to improve the work for this
final written presentation of your preliminary design.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="report-3-spring-midterm-progress-due-due-dates-rep-03-strftime-a-b-d-y">
<h2>Report #3: Spring Midterm Progress [Due: Friday, May 3, 2019]<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id27">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this report is to update the instructors and sponsors on your
progress, outline your deliverables, and to provide us with <em>draft</em> technical
documentation for your project.</p>
<p><strong>Note that the main content of the report should not exceed 3 pages but will
likely have a large appendix.</strong></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Deliverables</dt>
<dd>This section should describe the deliverables you plan to give to your
project sponsor at the end of the quarter. Example deliverables are design
reports, prototypes, software, user manuals, technical documentation,
manufacturing plans, analyses, etc. At the minimum, you must provide a final
design report for the class and the sponsors. If you build a prototype
(physical and/or software) you need to provide sufficient documentation so
that the sponsor can use or move forward with your design when you are no
longer involved.</dd>
<dt>Progress Update</dt>
<dd>This section should give us a clear picture of how well you are meeting your
schedule. It should show your current progress with respect to your original
schedule and any modifications you have now made to the schedule to meet
your goal given delays or saved time. Additionally, give an estimate of the
likelihood of providing the deliverables.</dd>
<dt>Engineering Standards</dt>
<dd>Tell us about any engineering standards that are relevant to your design.
For example, if you are designing a car for public roads it should meet SAE
standards. Or if you are designing an elevator it should meet ASME elevator
standards. See the <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/pages/technical-resources-and-tips.html">technical resources</a> page for information (especially
the UCD Mechanical Engineering page).</dd>
<dt>Technical Documentation</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This section should provide us with a description and drafts of any of the
technical documentation that you plan to create. Examples are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Working drawings of your mechanical and electrical designs. These should
include all information needed to manufacture your designs including
dimensions, material specifications, assembly diagrams, circuit diagrams,
wiring layouts, complete bill of materials, etc.</li>
<li>User documentation: This could be a user manual that describes how to use
and maintain the product or documentation on how to use software, etc.</li>
<li>Test results: The experimental/testing methodology and any results you
obtained.</li>
</ul>
<p class="last">We will provide feedback on this material so that your documentation can be
improved for the final report.</p>

<h2>Report #4: Final Design [Due: Sunday, Jun 9, 2019]<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id28">¶</a></h2>
<p>The final design report should be a comprehensive report detailing the final
version of your project. It is not necessary to provide information about the
process that led to this design. This report should have sufficient information
for someone unfamiliar with your project to understand what it is for, how to
fabricate it, and how to use it. The report should be self contained.</p>
<p>Be sure to utilize your past memos, reports, and critical design review as a
basis for your report. Use the feedback from them all to improve the work for
this final written presentation of your design.</p>
<div class="section" id="main-content">
<h3>Main Content<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id29">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>The main content should be no longer than 20 pages.</strong></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Introduction</dt>
<dd>Here, you should introduce your problem in context with respect to your
sponsor's work, their broader goals, society, and contemporary issues. Your
mission statement should be clearly defined with respect to these. The
sub-problems you have solved should be described and how they relate to the
main problem. This should also include any relevant existing solutions and
literature that helps put your problem and solution into context.</dd>
<dt>Needs, Specifications, and Standards</dt>
<dd>The sponsor's needs should be explained along with the target specifications
that you've developed from the needs. Be sure to note any engineering
standards that were used to set your specifications or were relevant to your
project.</dd>
<dt>Design Description</dt>
<dd>You should fully describe your design and explain how it functions. The goal
is to provide sufficient technical details to communicate the conceptual
design to the reader. Point out any features that you feel are novel and
unique. The system architecture should be presented through schematics and
drawings of the design, discussion of the various sub-systems, and
discussion of the interface between the various sub-systems. Be sure to make
heavy use of graphical means to communicate these ideas.</dd>
<dt>Design Justification</dt>
<dd>This section should present sufficient justification to prove that your
final design works, that the needs are satisfied, and that the target
specifications and standards have been met. You can justify your design in
two main ways: (1) engineering theoretical and computational analysis and
(2) demonstration that the design works through experimental testing. You
must provide (1) and can optionally provide (2) if your project included a
prototype and/or experiments.</dd>
<dt>Manufacturing</dt>
<dd>In this section, describe how you would or did manufacture your design.
Discuss how the design will be assembled and your choice of materials and
manufacturing processes. Include any ideas and projections about potential
mass production.</dd>
<dt>Deliverables</dt>
<dd>This section should list and describe the final, actual deliverables of your
project. This should include everything that you are providing your sponsor.</dd>
<dt>Conclusion</dt>
<dd>In this section, you can summarize the main innovations that your design
offers and reflect on any technical things that should be done differently
if the project is carried forward. Point out what are specific attributes
that you feel extremely positive about and note aspects that are weaknesses.
Discuss any work that you feel still needs to be performed and other changes
that would improve the design.</dd>

<div class="section" id="id8">
<h3>Appendices<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id30">¶</a></h3>
<p>The appendices should include any technical documentation needed to support the
main content of your paper. The general descriptions in the main content should
be supported by drawings and schematics of the mechanical, software, and
electrical systems. Other possible items to include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Mechanical layout drawings</li>
<li>Electrical schematics</li>
<li>Final bill of materials</li>
<li>Supporting calculations</li>
<li>Manufacturing guides</li>
<li>User manual</li>
<li>Experiment details and results</li>
<li>Explanatory code snippets</li>
<li>Full set of needs and specs</li>
<li>CAD renderings</li>
<li>Engineering standards details</li>
</ul>
<p>You may submit your drawing package (mechanical, electrical, etc) and any
manuals you create as separate PDF documents if that makes it easier to compile
your final report. For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>PDF #1: Report + appendices</li>
<li>PDF #2: Mechanical drawings</li>
<li>PDF #3: Usage manual</li>
</ul>
