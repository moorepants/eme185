Lecture and Activity Materials
==============================

- Copyright sensitive lecture slides and documents will be shared on the
  "Files" tab of Canvas.

Technical Resources
===================

Check out this webpage for a list of `technical resources`_ from the web that
may help you with your project.

Purchasing Parts and Materials
==============================

You may need to purchase parts and materials for your project with funds that
are provided by (or by proxy through) the MAE department. Please review the
`Purchasing Guidelines`_ to learn how to do this. Take special note that you
will need an online prepurchasing (OPP) account (more information on the
page). Do this well in advance of needing to submit an order request.

For some general advice on finding parts and materials, there is a `Purchasing
Tips`_ page.

Project Storage
===============

We have a space that is available for temporary storage of your project while
you are working on it during the spring quarter. You can get access to this
room, Bainer 1120, by asking one of the instructors for the keypad entry code.
The following list shows the rules for the use of the space. Any abuse of these
will cause all teams to lose access to the space. The ESDC staff are monitoring
and managing the space, so check in with them with any questions on the use of
the space.

- You should only request the key code if you actually need space.
- Do not share the keypad entry key code outside of your team. If you do, then
  you jeopardize the security people's projects.
- Group your items into as few labeled boxes/shelves/tables as possible.
- Label all boxes and any freestanding items with a contact name and phone
  number.
- Keep the space tidy. In particular, there should be no tripping hazards.
- No hazardous chemicals, paint, glue, or any things that require SDS.
- All work with power tools should happen in the ESDC.
- The MAE groups can use the floor space marked with an "M". The floor space
  marked with a "B" is for the biomedical capstone course.
- Share the tables and space with your fellow classmates.
- Make sure the doors to the hallway and courtyard are always left locked and
  closed.
- Do not touch any equipment in the room that doesn't belong to you.
- All items must be removed from the room by
  {{ DUE_DATES['workroom'].strftime('%A, %b %-d, %Y') }} or you risk an
  incomplete grade for the course.
- Respect the ESDC staff's wishes and help, as they have the final say on the
  use of the space.
- The keypad entry code will be changed at the end of quarter.
- Long pants, closed to shoes, and safety glass are required while in the
  space.

College of Engineering Design Showcase
======================================

At the end of the course you will be expected to present your results to
faculty, students, and visitors at the College of Engineering Design Showcase.
This year's showcase will be at the ARC Pavilion on
**{{ DUE_DATES['show'].strftime('%A, %b %-d, %Y') }}** from 1:30 to 4:30 pm and
registration will open in April. At the showcase you will meet with industry
sponsors and will have the opportunity to win various awards and to show off
your work to potential employers.

Out-of-the-box Resume Websites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some people try to standout and skip the single white sheet of paper. Here are
some examples of doing something unique and different. This is easier for
software engineers, but there are likely clever ways to showcase your
mechanical engineering prowess that isn't tied to a sheet of paper.
