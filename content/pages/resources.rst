Check out this webpage for a list of `technical resources`_ from the web that
may help you with your project.

Purchasing Parts and Materials
==============================

You may need to purchase parts and materials for your project with funds that
are provided by (or by proxy through) the MAE department. Please review the
`MAE Purchasing Guidelines`_ to learn how to do this. Take special note that
you will need an online purchasing system (OPS) account (more information on
the page). Do this well in advance of needing to submit an order request.

For some general advice on finding parts and materials, there is a `Purchasing
Tips`_ page.

Project Storage
===============

We have a space that is available for temporary storage of your project while
you are working on it during the spring quarter. You can get access to this
room, Bainer 1231, by asking your TA for the keypad entry code. The following
list shows the rules for the use of the space. Any abuse of these will cause
all teams to lose access to the space. The EFL staff are monitoring and
managing the space, so check in with them with any questions on the use of the
space.

- You should only request the key if you actually need space.
- Do not share the keypad entry key code. If you do, then you jeopardize the
  security people's projects.
- Group your items into as few labeled boxes/shelves/tables as possible.
- Label all boxes and any freestanding items with a contact name and phone
  number.
- Keep the space tidy. In particular, there should be no tripping hazards.
- No hazardous chemicals, paint, glue, or any things that require SDS.
- All work with dangerous tools should happen in the EFL.
- Do not go upstairs or disturb the office space up there.
- The MAE groups can use the room closest to the hallway. The room closest to
  the Bainer courtyard is for the BME groups.
- Share the tables and space with your fellow classmates.
- Make sure the doors to the hallway and courtyard are always left locked and
  closed.
- Do not touch any equipment in the room that doesn't belong to you.
- All items must be removed from the room by Friday, June 16th or you risk an
  incomplete grade.
- Respect the EFL staff's wishes and help, as they have the final say on the
  use of the space.
- The keypad entry code will be changed at the end of quarter.

College of Engineering Design Showcase
======================================

At the end of the course you will be expected to present your results to
faculty, students, and visitors at the College of Engineering Design Showcase.
This year's showcase will be at the ARC Pavilion on **June 8, 2017** from 2 to

Out-of-the-box Resume Websites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some people try to standout and skip the single white sheet of paper. Here are
some examples of doing something unique and different. This is easier for
software engineers, but there are likely clever ways to showcase your
mechanical engineering prowess that isn't tied to a sheet of paper.
