Recyclers in Cali, Colombia are a well organized guild of waste
pickers/collectors that work formally with the government and are part of the
waste management system. They generally work with carts that they build
themselves out of recycled waste. These designs do the job but improvements on
ergonomics, ease of transport and other needs exist such as the ability to keep
a cart from rolling down hill.

Other Requirements
==================

A significant number of students in this group must be fluent in Spanish so
that they can communicate with the stakeholders in Cali. It would also be ideal
if the students in this project enroll in D-Lab for the Winter and Spring
quarters.
