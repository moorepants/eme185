Assignments & Grades
====================

Letter grade based on design project and assignments related directly to the
project, and final exam for 185A.

Course Philosophy
=================

This course differs from almost all other courses that you have taken at the
University in that there is no predetermined list of theories, facts or
physical laws that you are expected to learn and master. The sole objective of
the design project course is to provide you with an opportunity to use your own
skills and knowledge to solve an engineering design problem. This experience
will help you make the transition from school to work; i.e., to bridge the gap
between theory and applications.

You are expected to attend every class, to use your own initiative to plan your
own outside work schedule, both in class and outside of class, and to complete
various major design project phases by their deadlines. Your instructor should
be viewed as a consultant and not as a taskmaster; he will not direct your work
effort or make your decisions, but is there to assist you with technical
engineering problems.

In 185A, a one-hour lecture is used each week to present material related to
the design process. Additionally, a 3-hour laboratory is used for group
activities, supplemental lecture material, and individual group meetings with
the instructor. Groups will follow the design process in their respective
projects. Groups are expected to meet regularly outside of formal class hours.
Groups will additionally meet with their project's faculty mentor on a regular
basis during the quarter for direction, group presentations and design reviews.
Based on the nature of the project, some groups will also meet with industry
sponsors on a regular basis. Towards the end of Fall Quarter, sessions will be
scheduled for project presentations to the entire class.

In 185B, each group will register for a 2-hour block of time for both meetings
with the instructor and to allow a common time for group meetings. Also, each
group will meet weekly with their project's faculty mentor. Additionally, many
of the projects will require group meetings with their corporate sponsors, and
these are additionally arranged based on everyone's schedules. There will be no
formal lecture time scheduled for 185B. During approximately the last week of
185B class, there will be a poster session to present the final designs to the
entire class. They are normally scheduled for late afternoon/early evening.

Student'S Role & Responsibility
===============================

Each student should view his/her role as that of an engineer as part of a
design team charged with the responsibility of managing and completing a design
project. As such you must do whatever is necessary to carry out this
responsibility. Specifically, your group must carry a design project from the
conception stage through the presentation stage. You are also responsible for
all written and oral reports and materials required by your instructor. Some
projects may require the fabrication of feasibility test components and/or
first generation prototype components. This may be accomplished through a
combination of student work in the engineering student faculty shop and/or the
corporate sponsor accepting this responsibility.

Instructor'S/Faculty Mentor'S Role & Responsibility
===================================================

Your instructor/faculty mentor has two primary responsibilities. First, he
will serve as an engineering consultant to the design project teams. In this
capacity, he expects to be kept informed of your project progress, have
discussions about design concepts and problems, point out appropriate reference
materials, suggest analysis methods, etc. He will not make engineering
decisions that he feels are rightly the responsibility of the design project
engineer, and he will generally play the role of devil's advocate in your
decision making process. Every student should keep in mind that the best time
to use your consultant is before your problem becomes unmanageable.

Your instructor's/faculty mentor's second responsibility is to evaluate your
performance and your design solution to the project. This is done by periodic
review of your progress (written and/or oral reports) and especially by
evaluation of your Final Design Project Report. It should be noted that each
project's sponsor will provide feedback that may contribute to final grading as
well.
