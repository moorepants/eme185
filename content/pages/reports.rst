Two reports will be due during the winter quarter and two reports will be due
during the spring quarter:

1. Project Proposal
2. Preliminary Design
3. Midterm Progress Update
4. Final Design Report

Please note that each report should be standalone. You may refer to earlier
reports, but each report should provide adequate information to allow a reader
to fully understand what is being presented and why. The reports should be
directed to other personnel that may not have detailed knowledge of the
project.

Report Format
=============

The reports will be due in PDF format via Canvas by the due dates and times
posted in the `schedule <{filename}/pages/schedule.rst>`_ and on the Canvas
assignment. A single report should be submitted by one team member.

- The report should fit on 8.5" x 11" sheets of paper [1]_.
- All margins should be 1".
- The font size of main text should be 11 or 12 pt.
- The font size in captions can be as small as 10 pt.
- Number and caption all figures and tables.
- Include page numbers on every sheet.
- Equations should be numbered and rendered as proper mathematical notation.
- Any standard citation style is permitted (e.g. IEEE, Havard, APA, MLA, etc.)
- The reports should be treated as a professional documents and formatted as
  such.
- The audience you should write for is a technically competent reader, e.g.
  another engineering colleague or engineering management.
- All graphics should be legible with adequate font sizes and clear lines.

For report writing tips see the slides from lecture that are available on
Canvas.

.. [1] Be sure to either scale layout drawings correctly with legible font
   sizes or print them in the appendices on larger paper sizes.

Title Page
----------

The title page should include the title, authors, team name, project title,
date, course section, and an abstract (~150 words).

Table of Contents
-----------------

The next page(s) of your report should include a table of contents, list of
figures, and list of tables showing a title and page number for all items.

Content Sections
----------------

These sections should contain the essential text, figures, tables, etc. to tell
your story. This main content should stand on its own without having to delve
into the optional appendices.

References
----------

All text and materials in the paper that were not created by your team must be
cited here. Be sure to up-hold copyright laws on any included material. Use any
citation style that you prefer that fully communicates the reference.

Appendices
----------

The appendices can be any length and contain details that do not belong in the
content section(s). This could include large figures, sketches, layout
drawings, 3D renderings, detailed calculations, big tables, short source code
snippets, etc. Basically, anything that takes attention away from the main
points but provides the details that back them up should go in the appendices.
Keep in mind that the content sections should stand on their own. Additionally,
feel free to link to rich media: videos, websites, demos, etc.

Definitions
===========

Layout Drawings
   You should refer to a good engineering graphics text for examples of layout
   drawings. We expect you to create layout drawings for your mechanical,
   electrical, and architectural designs. A mechanical layout drawing is drawn
   to scale and must show the shape, size, and position of all parts. It should
   show how the parts fit together and if they will function properly. The
   design details are worked out on this drawing. The designer additionally
   uses the layout drawing to show and sell his design and ideas to his
   management; it is used by drafts people to prepare detailed part drawings
   and an assembly drawing; it is used by manufacturing engineers to determine
   manufacturing processes and costs although this has been increasingly
   incorporated into the design process.  How detailed should it be? It must be
   adequately complete so that it can meet the above uses. If it is not
   necessary to ask how the design works or what a particular part looks like,
   etc., then the layout is adequate.
Bill of Materials
   The Bill of Materials or Parts List is a tabular list of all of the parts,
   components, sub-assemblies, etc. that are needed to manufacture and/or test
   your design. Both manufactured items and purchased items are included. The
   list should include part numbers, part names, number required, material,
   whether purchased or fabricated, and if purchased, the name and part number
   of the supplier with associated costs. The Bill of Materials is used for
   such aspects as: insuring that all parts are on hand when production begins,
   to ensure that detailed drawings are prepared for all components, for
   planning of the manufacturing process, etc.

Report #1: Project Proposal [Due: February 10th, 2017]
======================================================

The primary purpose of the project proposal is for your team to clearly
articulate your understanding of the customer's needs and to share your
preliminary research findings, concepts, first quarter timeline, preliminary
budget, and goals. This story should convince your instructors and sponsors
that you have a clear understanding of the needs, have a realistic scope, and
are ready to move forward with design, analysis, concept selection.

This document should be shared with your sponsor(s) by email (cc the instructor
and TA) for feedback in addition to being turned into Canvas. Be sure to adjust
the content to best fit this combined audience.

**The main content sections of the report should not exceed 6 pages.**

The project proposal should address the following things:

Mission Statement
   State and define your problem and objectives as clearly as you can. If your
   proposal deals with the smaller component of a larger problem, discuss your
   problems significance relative to the total system.
Identified customer needs
   Use this section to show a more detailed view of the identified needs. It is
   important that you sponsor see that you've understood their needs. Note that
   you may also have discovered needs that your sponsor didn't explicitly
   describe, so use this opportunity to share those with your sponsor.
Refined target specifications
   List as many design specifications as you can at this time including such
   aspects as capacities, speeds, size, weight, cost, etc. as well as any other
   specific and/or general requirements and specifications for your design.
External concepts and existing solutions
   It should be clear that you've "done your homework", i.e. searched for
   existing solutions and used them to help develop your specifications and
   concepts. Compare specs from existing solutions to your desired specs.
Initial design concepts
   You should have a large number of concepts to share at this point. Be sure
   to show these off so that your sponsor can see that there are a wide range
   of possible solutions to their needs. You can highlight the most promising
   ideas.
Preliminary planning and scheduling
   The preliminary plan should give at least a coarse idea of the important
   milestones you will need to meet over the next quarter. You should include a
   `Gantt chart <{filename}/pages/gantt-chart.rst>`_ with the details.
Preliminary budget
   The purpose of the preliminary budget statement is to give a very rough idea
   of what expected project costs may be for your top designs. This will vary
   based on your or your sponsor's desire to construct a prototype or run
   testing. The instructors and sponsors will use this number to start planning
   resource allocation. A refined budget will be presented in the final report
   of the winter quarter.

You may add other information that is deemed necessary to "sell" your proposal.
Use your memos as building blocks for the proposal. The instructors and
sponsors will evaluate your report to determine the size and scope of your
project and if the objectives are both well thought out and feasible.

Report #2: Preliminary Design [Due: March 19th, 2017]
=====================================================

The purpose of the preliminary design report is to present your selected
design, show that it is highly likely to work and that your goals will
realistically be able to be completed by the end of the spring quarter. This
document should provide sufficient technical information, engineering analyses,
and/or test results to give the instructors and your sponsors confidence the
presented solution will meet the sponsors' needs and all of your target specs.
Additionally, you will need to clearly state what you plan to accomplish by the
end of the course and how you will do that.

Note that your design does not yet have to be complete and polished but the
main concepts should be formally described in enough technical detail to make
your case. Furthermore, it is not a requirement to have a physical realization
of your solution for this class. You sponsors are aware of this. You can pass
the course with high marks by presenting a comprehensive design that is ready
to be built, i.e. enough information to pass onto other engineers and/or
fabricators. But we encourage you to develop simple prototypes as part of the
design process and a final prototype for your sponsor, as you are likely to
learn much more by doing so and be better prepared for the future.

The report should cover at least the following topics:

Introduction
   You should introduce your problem in context with respect to your sponsors
   work and their broader goals. The sponsor's needs should be clearly
   explained along with the associated target specifications that you've
   developed from the needs. Your mission statement should be clearly defined
   with respect to these. The sub-problems you have to solve should be clearly
   described and how they relate to the main problem. This can also include
   comparisons of your solution to existing solutions and any relevant
   literature that helps put your problem and solution into context.
Concept Description
   Ideally, you are down to one concept or one plan of action (for
   computational and physical experiments) that you are ready to move forward
   with. You should fully describe your design to clearly explain how it
   functions. The goal is to provide sufficient technical details to get across
   the conceptual design. For example, how a mechanism will work or how all
   your parts will fit together in the limited physical space. Be sure to make
   heavy use of graphical means to communicate the design. The minimal
   description should be based on the "product architecture" described in
   Chapter 10 of the book and in class. The system architecture will be
   presented through preliminary schematics and layout drawings of the design,
   discussion of the various subsystems, and discussion of the interface
   between the various subsystems. But you are welcome to present more details
   of your design if you are further along.
Concept Justification
   Your selected design should have sufficient justification to prove that it
   is very likely to work. You can prove this in a number of ways, e.g.
   engineering analysis, simulation, experimental testing, or through simple
   prototyping. Simple analytical models and tests are sufficient to prove
   that concepts will likely work. You will be able to refine these during the
   second quarter to further justify your work. You can also describe your
   decisions to abandon other design concepts. This helps build your case that
   your design is the right choice.
Plan
   You should include a very refined project plan that breaks the remainder of
   the project timeline into a set of dependent tasks and milestones. Every
   task should have a duration, due date, its dependencies, and an assignee(s).
   This information should be presented as a `Gantt Chart
   <{filename}/pages/gantt-chart.rst>`_.
Financing
   The costs should be refined as much as possible to give a very realistic
   estimate of what you plan to spend. A bill of materials (see definition
   above) should be included with best estimates of all project costs. Be sure
   to account for shipping, tax, and any other indirect costs. This bill of
   materials will be your and the instructors' guide to purchasing.

   If your sponsor is not covering the costs (or all of the costs) of your
   project you will need to include a statement that requests money from the
   MAE department. You must include the amount of money from any other sources
   with this request. We will evaluate the requests and try to provide you with
   your requested amount from the limited available money by the start of the
   Spring quarter. There is no guarantee that you will get what you ask for.
   This will be based off the amount requested and the quality of your work.
Appendices
   The appendices should include any details that support the content of your
   paper. It should include sufficient details that document your work this
   quarter. This should be highly organized and easy to follow. At this point
   you can include details of your concept generation and selection process,
   your full set of needs and specs, CAD renderings, sketches, diagrams,
   abandoned designs, in-depth tasks lists and charts, extensive bill of
   materials, etc.

This report should be self contained. Imagine if someone that has never seen
your work picks up your report and wants to understand it in depth without you
present. Your report should include sufficient information for them to
understand your design and justification.

**Note that the main content of the report should not exceed 10 pages.**

Be sure to utilize your memos, proposal, and critical design review as a basis
for your report. Use the feedback from them all to improve the work for this
final written presentation of your preliminary design.

Report #3: Spring Midterm Progress [Due: May 5, 2017]
=====================================================

The purpose of this report is to update the instructors and sponsors on your
progress, outline your deliverables, and to provide us with *draft* technical
documentation for your project.

**Note that the main content of the report should not exceed 3 pages but will
likely have a large appendix.**

Deliverables
   This section should describe the deliverables you plan to give to your
   project sponsor at the end of the quarter. Example deliverables are design
   reports, prototypes, software, user manuals, technical documentation,
   manufacturing plans, analyses, etc. At the minimum, you must provide a final
   design report for the class and the sponsors. If you build a prototype
   (physical and/or software) you need to provide sufficient documentation so
   that the sponsor can use or move forward with your design when you are no
   longer involved.
Progress Update
   This section should give us a clear picture of how well you are meeting your
   schedule. It should show your current progress with respect to your original
   schedule and any modifications you have now made to the schedule to meet
   your goal given delays or saved time. Additionally, give an estimate of the
   likelihood of providing the deliverables.
Technical Documentation
   This section should provide us with a description and drafts of any of the
   technical documentation that you plan to create. Examples are:

   - Working drawings of your mechanical and electrical designs. These should
     include all information needed to manufacture your designs including
     dimensions, material specifications, assembly diagrams, circuit diagrams,
     wiring layouts, complete bill of materials, etc.
   - Engineering standards that are relevant to your design. For example, if
     you are designing a car for public roads it should meet SAE standards. Or
     if you are designing an elevator it should meet ASME elevator standards.
   - User documentation: This could be a user manual that describes how to use
     and maintain the product or documentation on how to use software, etc.
   - Test results: The experimental/testing methodology and any results you
     obtained.

   We will provide feedback on this material so that your documentation can be
   improved for the final report.

Report #4: Final Design [Due: June 9, 2017]
===========================================

The final design report should be a comprehensive report detailing the final
version of your project. It is not necessary to provide information about the
process that led to this design. This report should have sufficient information
for someone unfamiliar with your project to understand what it is for, how to
fabricate it, and how to use it. The report should be self contained.

Be sure to utilize your past memos, reports, and critical design review as a
basis for your report. Use the feedback from them all to improve the work for
this final written presentation of your design.

Main Content
------------

**The main content should be no longer than 15 pages.**

Introduction
   Here, you should introduce your problem in context with respect to your
   sponsors work and their broader goals. Your mission statement should be
   clearly defined with respect to these. The sub-problems you have solved
   should be described and how they relate to the main problem. This should
   also include any relevant existing solutions and literature that helps put
   your problem and solution into context.
Needs, Specifications, and Standards
   The sponsor's needs should be explained along with the target specifications
   that you've developed from the needs. Note any engineering standards that
   are relevant to your project.
Design Description
   You should fully describe your design and explain how it functions. The goal
   is to provide sufficient technical details to communicate the conceptual
   design to the reader. Point out any features that you feel are novel and
   unique. The system architecture should be presented through schematics and
   drawings of the design, discussion of the various sub-systems, and
   discussion of the interface between the various sub-systems. Be sure to make
   heavy use of graphical means to communicate these ideas.
Design Justification
   This section should present sufficient justification to prove that your
   final design works, that the needs are satisfied, and that the target
   specifications have been met. You can justify your design in two main ways:
   (1) engineering theoretical and computational analysis and (2) demonstration
   that the design works through experimental testing. You must provide (1) and
   can optionally provide (2) if your project included a prototype and/or
   experiments.
Manufacturing
   In this section, describe how you would or did manufacture your design.
   Discuss how the design will be assembled and your choice of materials and
   manufacturing processes. Include any ideas about potential mass production.
Deliverables
   This section should list and describe the final, actual deliverables of your
   project. This should include everything that you are providing your sponsor.
Conclusion
   In this section, you can summarize the main innovations that your design
   offers and reflect on any technical things that should be done differently
   if the project is carried forward. Point out what are specific attributes
   that you feel extremely positive about and note aspects that are weaknesses.
   Discuss any work that you feel still needs to be performed and other changes
   that would improve the design.

Appendices
----------

The appendices should include any technical documentation needed to support the
main content of your paper. The general descriptions in the main content should
be supported by drawings and schematics of the mechanical, software, and
electrical systems. Other possible items to include:

- Mechanical layout drawings
- Electrical schematics
- Final bill of materials
- Supporting calculations
- Manufacturing guides
- User manual
