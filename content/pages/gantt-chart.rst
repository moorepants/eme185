A Gantt chart displaying your team's progress and plans throughout the quarter
will be required for the weekly AIOs and the reports. Here are some tips for
generating a quality Gantt chart.

No matter what tool you decide to use for creating a Gantt chart, make sure the
chart you submit is legible and shows the full timeline of the project. Vector
formats (e.g. PDF) are preferred because they can be fit to a standard page
size, and they can be zoomed into without losing legibility. Here is an `example <{filename}/docs/Shoe-Tie-Machine_GANTT.pdf>`_ of a Gantt chart from a previous EME 185 project.

InstaGantt
----------

InstaGantt_ is a Gantt chart tool that integrates with Asana_, an application
for organizing team projects. Once you've generated the chart contents with the
application, you can use its export functionality to generate either
a high-resolution image or (preferably) a PDF for attachment to the AIO email.
A screenshot of the application interface is not recommended since it usually
results in poor resolution and doesn't show the full schedule.

One of the requirements for the Gantt charts you submit is that they should
indicate the current date. The blue column indicating the current date in the
application interface unfortunately does not show up in the exported output, so
here is a workaround:

- Select a single day in the application; a context menu should appear
- Click the "Highlight day" option
- Change any settings you want and click "Continue"
- This highlighted day will now show up in the exported chart

Here are some recommended options for exporting the chart:

- Use the day time scale
- Use the Gantt view type
- Include either the task list or the task names next to the bars
