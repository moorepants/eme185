Preliminary Design Review [{{ DUE_DATES['pre_01'].strftime('%b %-d, %Y') }}]
===================================================================================================

Your team will be scheduled for a 50 minute preliminary design review during
the ninth week of the winter quarter. The first 5 minutes will be for setup
followed by your 25 minute presentation. This will be followed by 20 minutes
for the review questions and discussion. The primary purpose of this review is
for your team to justify your concept selection and design decisions through
technical details and analysis. We are not as concerned with the path to the
final design (i.e., initial concepts, etc.) but what the final concept is and
why you feel confident it will work. The intent of design reviews is to insure
that the proper methods are being used in analyses and that the design is valid
and valuable, i.e. it meets specifications, it can be manufactured, etc. Both
your teaching assistant and the primary instructor will be present along with
other potential reviewers. The presentation should be geared toward and
"engineering management" audience. **Every team member should have a
significant speaking role.**

Suggestions of what to include:

- Context and background of your project.
- A technical description of the need you are trying to solve.
- The primary specs and metrics your solution must meet.
- A detailed technical description of your selected concept and solution.
- Justification for your concept solution in terms of meeting the engineering
  specifications.
- Theoretical or experimental proof that your selected concept and preliminary
  design is very likely to succeed.
- Any relevant technical preliminary design details.
- A schedule and financial plan to execute your design.

This is essentially the presentation form of the second report, which is due
the last week of class.

**You will need to submit your presentation materials as a PDF to Canvas by
Friday of the week of the presentationn.**

Preliminary Design Lightning Talk [{{ DUE_DATES['pre_02'].strftime('%b %-d, %Y') }}]
===================================================================================================

During the last studio section your team will present their work and
preliminary design to the entire class, the instructors, and any project
sponsors that can attend. Groups will present their design concepts and will
justify their final selected concept.

The presentations will be 5 minutes comprised of an overview of the project and
selected design concept. This will be followed by 3 minutes for questions and
changing groups. Only one team member will deliver the presentation, but all
team members must prepare to speak. The team member will be selected randomly
from the group at the time of presentation. This presentation will be good
practice for a high level presentation in industry (for example, to high level
executives). All students are required to attend this session.

**You will need to submit your presentation materials as a PDF to Canvas by
Friday of that week.**

Engineering Design Showcase Poster Presentation [{{ DUE_DATES['pre_03'].strftime('%b %-d, %Y') }}]
===================================================================================================

Your team will be required to present your work at the `Engineering Design
Showcase`_ at the ARC Pavilion on {{ DUE_DATES['show'].strftime('%A %b %-d,
%Y') }} from 1:30-4:30 pm. You need to `register for the showcase`_ by {{
DUE_DATES['show_reg'].strftime('%A %b %-d, %Y') }}. Each team will develop a
poster that showcases and explains your project which must be submitted to both
Canvas and to the Dean's office for printing by {{
DUE_DATES['pre_03'].strftime('%A %b %-d, %Y') }}. If you don't turn it in on
time you will jeopardize having the $75+ cost of printing covered for you. You
are also welcome and encouraged to bring any prototype that you have
constructed or videos and other media that will explain your project. Any
special accommodations for your prototype (size, power, etc) or presentation
must be coordinated with the Dean's office at registration. At least one member
of the team must be present at the poster at all times from 1:30-4:30 pm and
all team members must attend the event. Your team's poster will be visited by
one or more industry judges who will score your poster. You should were
business attire. Your TA will visit your poster for approximately 10 minutes,
interact with you,and will grade your poster presentation for the class.

Content Suggestions
-------------------

Keep in mind that the posters should be designed for a more general audience.
Most of the visitors to the showcase will either be students, faculty, staff,
or representatives from industry. So the poster should be understandable by
people that aren't necessarily mechanical engineers. Your poster should
address:

- A description of your project.
- The main need or needs and how you've addressed them.
- Why your project is a great solution.
- Any innovative things you've come up with.

You can get ideas for posters by checking out the previous posters in the files
section of Canvas or those that are hanging in Bainer Hall.

There are many websites offering tips on making posters. Here is a good one for
scientific posters, but most of the advice is also applicable to your poster
design:

http://hsp.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/ScientificPosters.pdf

Your poster should sell your ideas and yourselves. This is a great opportunity
to show your engineering prowess to the world!

Software
--------

Posters can be created with a variety of software packages, for example:

- Slide decks software (MS Powerpoint, LibreOffice Impress, Google
  Presentations, etc.)
- `Publishing software <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing>`_ (MS
  Publisher, Scribus, Adobe InDesign)
- Word processors (MS Word, LaTeX, etc.)
- Graphics (Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, Photoshop, Gimp, etc.)

UCD Logos
---------

If you'd like to use UCD logos in your poster you can find information about
them at http://marketingtoolbox.ucdavis.edu/identity/logos/index.html.

Template
--------

Below are links to two possible poster templates for you to use as a basis for your poster.
Feel free to modify the colors, fonts, layout, etc. There is no obligation to
use the template

- Template 1: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DhddKWEk8GZJZDMotgJ7H-AxJdSh_fJkB5Cm2gQve-E
- Template 2: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1V87_YdZN8SC0j1IxQNklPuRvdMok_Iwn

Instructions:

- **Google Slides**: open the link, then go to ``File -> Add to My Drive``.
  This will copy the template to your personal Google Drive account so you can
  collaboratively edit it with your team members via Google Slides.
- **PowerPoint**: open the link, then go to ``File -> Download as -> Microsoft
  PowerPoint (.pptx)``. Save the file where you want and you should then be
  able to open it with PowerPoint.
- **LibreOffice**: either use the above instructions for PowerPoint, or use
  ``File -> Download as -> ODP Document (.odp)``. A reasonably up-to-date
  version of LibreOffice should be able to open both file types.

If you have issues opening the file or if the template doesn't look right when
you open it, let your TA know.

Examples
--------

Here are a few example posters for inspiration. These examples are
research-oriented, but they may provide some ideas for structuring, laying out,
and designing your poster:

members should read this message carefully and completely to ensure a timely
and quality product.

1. The Engineering Dean's Office will cover the cost of printing one landscape
   48" W x 36" H full-color poster per team. No other dimensions or sizes will
   be allowed. Only 1 poster per team will be printed (no reprints).
2. The poster PDF file must be emailed to amwakefield@ucdavis.edu no later than
   {{ POSTER_DUE_DATE }} *and* submitted to Canvas assignments at the same
   time. Alin will not accept nor print any file received after this deadline.
3. Files must be submitted as a PDF (highest quality preferred).
4. When designing your poster, please carefully check the page setup settings.
   You must ensure your poster is correctly sized at 48" W x 36" H.
5. The CoE cannot be responsible for verifying the accuracy of technical
   content, so you are strongly advised to have your instructor review your
   poster prior to submission.
6. Once printed, the posters will be stored in 1050 Kemper Hall. Alin will
   arrange for setup and display of all posters in the Pavilion on June 8th.
   Posters will be mounted to foam/poster board for stability and easier
   viewing.
7. If you do not want to keep your poster you should return it to the
   instructors after the showcase and it will be displayed in Bainer Hall the
   following year.

Critical Design Review [{{ DUE_DATES['pre_04'].strftime('%b %-d, %Y') }}]
===================================================================================================

Critical Design Reviews will be held during the first three days of exam week.
Your team will be scheduled for a 50 minute critical design review during
finals week of spring quarter. The first 5 minutes will be for setup followed
by your 25 minute presentation. This will be followed by 20 minutes for the
review questions and discussion.

The primary purpose of this review is for your team to justify that your design
solves your sponsors needs through technical details, analysis, and testing. We
are not necessarily concerned with the path to the final design (i.e., initial
concepts, etc.) but what the final design is and why you feel confident it
solves the sponsor's needs. Additionally, the intent of critical design review
is to insure that the proper methods are being used in analyses and that the
design is valid and valuable, i.e. it meets specifications, it can be
manufactured, etc. The content should mirror the main content of the final
design report.

Your teaching assistant, the primary instructor and potentially your sponsor
and other potential guests will be present. The presentation should be geared
toward and "engineering management" audience.

**You will need to submit your presentation materials as a PDF to Canvas by
10PM Wednesday of exam week.**
