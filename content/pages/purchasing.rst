EME 185 A/B Capstone MAE Purchasing And Out-Of-Pocket Reimbursement Guidelines

Key Guidelines
==============

- Project funds are only granted through an approved Bill of Materials (BOM).  The first BOM was submitted in your Preliminary Design Report at the end of the first quarter.
- There are two additional oppurtunities (making 3 in total) to request/change funds for your project.  These will be submitted via BOM Change Orders described below.
- Once funds are approved, proceed with purchasing only the items from your BOM by any of the means described below.
- Students from BME funded projects do not have access to the OPS and must submit purchase requests through their TA. These submissions can only occur every two weeks.
- The University does not have an Amazon Prime account.
- We've been having issues getting POs for Home Depot, please send a request
  for a reimbursement prior to making a purchase.

- place orders
- submit packing slips to MAE Office

OPS User Registration
=====================

**On-line Purchase System (OPS) Link**: http://ops.engineering.ucdavis.edu

See above OPS link. Team or Purchasing Lead: Contact one of the MAE staff to
register as OPS user and obtain a brief OPS user training. Provide your
Kerberos ID and phone number (cell phone preferably) for OPS user registration
to MAE staff.

Note that the required "unit" column in the web form is to specify the unit of

Order for Supplies and Consumables using a Department Purchase Order (DPO)
==========================================================================

**BME funded projects must have their TA place the orders!** See the "Ordering for BME Funded Projects" section for more info.

Applicable to Store Pickup, FAX/Internet Order, Credit Card Order

- Obtain approval and correct account # for the order from the instructor.
  Your requested purchases must match your pre-approved bill of materials.
- Submit a complete OPS order via http://ops.engineering.ucdavis.edu.
  Order will e-route to the instructor and the MAE staff for approvals.
- Include in the OPS order: # of items, unit price, item/catalog #. Attach a
  price quotation or screen shot of product information if needed.
- If you have a large list of items from an online vendor, save the order in
  CART with your exact items in it and provide a copy to OPS as an attachment.
- Include shipping/handling charges when you calculate the total order for
  budgeting purposes. Charges may vary depending on delivery method (regular
  ground vs. overnight). RUSH order will incur extra shipping costs. For RUSH
  shipment, obtain approval from your instructor.
- Verify with the vendor that item is in stock and available for shipment
  within the timeframe needed.
- Submit packing slips as soon as possible to process payment of invoices.
- Plan ahead to avoid unnecessary high shipping charges.

You can ship items to the department and they will notify you via email when
they arrive:

| <your name>
| Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department
| Bainer Hall, Room 2132
| University of California, Davis
| One Shields Avenue
| Davis, CA 95616

Ordering for BME Funded Projects
================================
Projects funded through the UC Davis Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC)
or UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine require a purchasing information to be sent
to the TA so the TA can place the orders. A table or spreadsheet organized alphabetically
by vendor with the following information must be sent to your team's TA via e-mail:

1. Vendor Name
2. Quantity of item
3. Unit
4. Part Number (if applicable)
5. Item Description and URL
6. Unit Cost

+--------------+----+------+----------------------------+------------------+----------+
|Vendor        |QTY |Unit  |Part Number (if applicable) |Description       |Unit Cost |
+==============+====+======+============================+==================+==========+
|Amazon.com    |2   |Pack  | N/A                        |Cables,<URL>      |   5.00   |
+--------------+----+------+----------------------------+------------------+----------+
|Amazon.com    |1   |Each  | N/A                        |Arduino,<URL>     |  19.99   |

Local Purchases
===============

To place an order at a local store for pickup, these are the procedures to
follow:

1. Go to local store and record quantity and part number of items or make a
   conservative guess at the prices.
2. Place OPS order listing the normal quantity, unit, parts number,
   description. Use the "Not to exceed amount" column to give a conservative
   dollar amount needed for the purchase.
3. Check box in OPS for "order for pick up"
4. OPS will give a purchase order in the amount needed to pick up the items at
   the local store
5. Return the receipt as the "packing slip"

Reimbursement for Out-of-Pocket Expenses
========================================

UCD policy strongly discourages out-of-pocket expenses. However, emergency
expenses may be unavoidable due to extenuating circumstances (e.g., no access
to a Purchase Order after MAE office hours; emergency purchase; Department
Purchase Order not accepted by a store/vendor).

Out-of-pocket expenses must be PRE-APPROVED by one of the instructors and must
be deemed necessary for the capstone design project.

**Total out-of-pocket purchases (including tax and shipping cost) must not
exceed $500 per receipt.**

- Complete an Engineering Reimbursement Request form
  (http://mae.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ExpenseReimbursement.pdf)
  and obtain instructor’s approval.
- Save and sign the original receipts if signature specimen is not already on
  the receipt.
- Submit the completed form, along with original receipts, to one of the MAE
  staff, 2132 Bainer Office.

Bill of Materials Change Orders
===============================
As professional engineers, you have a fiduciary responsibility to spend your sponsor’s 
funds in the best interest of the project.  Therefore, it is critical that you plan your 
purchases prudently.  That said, there is no way to foresee all the stumbling blocks 
that will occur over the course of this quarter and additional purchases are almost certain.

There will be a cap of two additional BOM changes for the remainder of the quarter. Any
changes to your BOM must be justified and approved before funds are released.
Change requests will be submitted as a one-page memo answereing each of the 
following questions:  
 
1. What are you changing?
2. Why are you chainging it?
3. What do you need to purchase in order to facilitate this change?

You must also submit an abridged BOM of the changes indicating what additionally is needed 
including all vendors, part numbers, quantities and cost.  The new BOM can be an attachment 
and need not fit within the one-page limit of the memo.   These will be sent to the 
instructor, your TA, and your sponsor for approval.  When your funds are approved, you can 
purchase through any of the above means.

Tips

- Plan your purchases well in advance to avoid rush orders and unnecessary high
  shipping charges.
