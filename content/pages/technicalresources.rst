:title: Technical Resources and Tips
:status: hidden

In the course of making your project or product successful, you will have to
draw on your team's combined knowledge, experience and talents as an engineer.
But a good engineer also does not waste time 'reinventing the wheel' from
scratch. There is a wealth of knowledge and resources available in the form of
books,articles and videos on the internet and the UCDavis' Physical Sciences
and Engineering Library.  Here is a list of some of these resources that you
may want to use:

UCDavis Library Resources
-------------------------

The `Physical Sciences and Engineering (PSE) Library webpage`_ provides you
access to a vast collection of resources that may not be readily available on
the internet ranging from full Books, eBooks, Journals, Databooks, Patents and
Industry Standards. Many of these are available in digital form. Some may
require you to use the Library VPN to sign in. We encourage you to make use of
these university resources in your projects. Remember to cite your references
in your reports. The above webpage also contains a citation guide.

Making Technical Drawings
-------------------------

Here are a few resources and references for making your technical drawings
package (your major deliverable) look professional and informative.

- `ASME/ANSI Y14.5 Standards
  <https://tutorialcadcam.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/asme-y14-5m-2009.pdf>`_
  Please read from section 1.4 onwards to check if you are following the right
  dimensioning conventions defined in the standard.

Other ASME Y14 standards that define Lines and Lettering, sheet size and
formats and Drawing Views are linked to below:

- `ASME/ANSI Y14.1 Standards <http://gost-snip.su/download/asme_y14_12005_decimal_inch_drawing_sheet_size_and_format_re>`_
- `ASME/ANSI Y14.2 Standards <http://gost-snip.su/download/asme_y14_22008_line_conventions_and_lettering>`_
- `ASME/ANSI Y14.3 Standards <http://gost-snip.su/download/asme_y14_32003_multiview_and_sectional_view_drawings>`_
