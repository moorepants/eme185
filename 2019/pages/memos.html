<p>You will develop a number of memos that document your team's accomplishments
and progress. The memos should all be turned in to Canvas Assignments by 10 PM
on the respective due date.</p>
<p>Each memo should stand on its own and you will be able to use the content as a
base to develop the reports. In addition to turning in the assignment, you
should share these memos with your project sponsor(s) for feedback but the main
audience you should address are the course instructors.</p>
<p>The memos should have no more than <strong>two pages</strong> of main content and an
optional appendices. The &quot;main content&quot; is defined as the essential text,
figures, tables, etc. to tell your story. Additionally, feel free to link to
rich media: videos, websites, demos, etc. This main content should stand on its
own without the appendices. The appendices can include labeled and captioned
figures, tables, drawings, renderings, analyses, source code, and other
relevant material to support the story told in your main content pages if the
reader desires to understand further details. Reference the items in the
appendices in the main text. The appendices should not be required to
understand the main content.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Each memo must be submitted as a single PDF document made up of 8.5&quot; x 11&quot;
sheets to Canvas. <strong>You will be docked points if you submit a format other
than PDF.</strong></li>
<li>Your group is free to use any software you prefer to prepare the documents.
<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>.</li>
<li>The audience you should write for is a technically competent reader, e.g.
another engineering colleague or engineering management, and/or your project
sponsor.</li>
<li>They should be treated as a professional documents and formatted as such.</li>

<h2>Memo 1: Project Selection [Due: Friday, Jan 11, 2019]<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id6">¶</a></h2>
<p>This &quot;memo&quot; will be in the form of a CATME Team Maker Survey and your résumé.
You will receive a notice via email for CATME and will need to fill out the
survey on the CATME website. Your résumé should be turned in via Canvas as a
single PDF. <strong>Note that your résumé should not exceed more that two pages.</strong></p>
<p>The CATME Survey will be accessed via this link:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.catme.org/">https://www.catme.org/</a></p>
<p>Resources for developing your résumé can be found on the
<a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/2019/pages/resources.html">resources page</a>.</p>
<p>CATME takes into account all of the information that you provide it and
attempts to algorithmically select optimal teams to align schedules, distribute
similar and dissimilar qualities, and ensure a project of your choice. We will
read your your résumé to get to know you a bit better and to provide you
feedback for improving it for the upcoming <a class="reference external" href="https://icc.ucdavis.edu/employer/fairs.htm">Engineering Career Fair</a> (Wednesday, Jan 30, 2019).  You will also provide
your résumé to your project client once your team is assigned.</p>
<p>I make all of my projects available to students in both sections (A02, A03) but
each selected group will have to attend the same section. If you are willing to
switch from attending Thursday to attending Friday or vice versa, then you will
have a larger chance of getting the project you want. Please indicate in the
survey if you can switch sections <strong>only if you have no time conflicts</strong>.</p>

<h2>Memo 2: Team Charter [Due: Friday, Jan 18, 2019]<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id7">¶</a></h2>
<p>A team charter is a document that specifies your team's purpose and the
organizational principles you will use to fulfill that purpose. Generating
a team charter is an important process that will help to establish team goals,
list strategies to achieve those goals, identify strengths of individual team
members, and formalize team members' agreements and commitments to one another.</p>
<p>Throughout the next two quarters, refer back to your charter to ensure that
you're on the course you set for yourselves at the beginning. Your charter is
a living document, however, so you should also revise it if member roles and
responsibilities change throughout the project.</p>
<p>With your group members, select a company name and write a 1-page charter
following this <a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/2019/pages/team-charter-template.html">team charter template</a>.</p>

<h2>Memo 3: Needs and Specs [Due: Friday, Feb 1, 2019]<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id8">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this memo is to summarize what you have learned from the
stakeholders in your project, in particular your sponsors' needs and desired
outcomes. You should use the initial conversations with the sponsor to learn as
much as possible. <strong>As soon as the projects are assigned you should initiate
contact with your sponsor for an interview.</strong></p>
<p>For the first part of the memo, the purpose will be to communicate the
sponsor's needs in your own language as you understand them, including implicit
needs you identify which the sponsor may not explicitly state. We recommend
using the techniques explained in Chapter 5 and in class to generate these
needs.</p>
<p>Secondly, you should show preliminary target specifications based on the needs
that you have found. Techniques for generating the specifications from the
needs are provided in Chapter 6, where the first portion explains getting to
target specs. Additionally, you should being to look into various codes and
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard">standards</a> that your project may be relevant to your project. See the
<a class="reference external" href="https://moorepants.github.io/eme185/2019/pages/technical-resources-and-tips.html">technical resources</a> page for more information on these.</p>
<p>You should create tables and charts that you find in Chapter 5 and 6 to
organize your needs and specifications. These may be large and thus should
likely be attached in the appendix of the memo. You should summarize the
findings in the main two pages of the memo.</p>
<p>Items to include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Summary of the problem, i.e. the mission statement.</li>
<li>The organized identified needs as an attachment (appendices). At the minimum
a comprehensive table like Exhibit 5-8 is required.</li>
<li>The organized target specifications as an attachment (appendices). At the
minimum a comprehensive table like Exhibit 6-8 is required. At least two
specifications should come from relevant engineering standards or codes.</li>
<li>Reflections on the process and the results.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Memo 4: Selection and Architecture [Due: Friday, Mar 1, 2019]<a class="toc-backref headerlink" href="#id9">¶</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of this memo is to show that you have narrowed down your concepts
and have a solution that you want to move forward with. Ideally, you have one
concept at this point, but if not, you should be down to a very minimal set of
choices and have a strong justification as to why you are having a hard time
deciding. It should be evident that your selected concept has a very high
probability of meeting your client's needs and solving your problem.</p>
<p>Suggestions of what to include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">A description of your selected concept.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The product architecture of your selected concept. At minimum include an architecture
diagram like Exhibit 10-7.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Include an annotated drawing or figure depicting your design like the Exhibit 8-6.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Evidence that the concept will meet the client's needs.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Justification for your elimination of the abandoned concepts.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Documentation of your selection process in the form of any screening or
scoring charts/tables/graphs, etc.</p>
